## Transcription

Okay, so I challenged myself to build an app that reaches $2000 of monthly profits starting from scratch as a student. I thought 30 days max. Well, that's what I thought because a lot can go wrong. Apple rejections: content strategies that completely flop and eating zero dollars thinking it's over. And you'll see it ends up a lot closer to 60 days. Through this challenge, I'm going to test different ideas, different strategies, but most importantly, I'm gonna prove to you that even as a CS student doing a remote internship, you can build something that actually makes money. But before we start who I am and why should you care? I'm Arthur, I'm 20, fourth year of computer science. Last year, I co-founded an AI startup for doctors. We raised money, built for month, but long story short, that was a complete failure. We never talked to users in your market fit and build features nobody wanted. But that failure taught me more than all my classes combined. So that's why I started this YouTube channel: to prove that you don't need the perfect ID, you don't need funding and you don't even need to know everything. Stop waiting and start building In this video, I'm showing everything, no filter. How I found the ID, built it, failed it and iterated until people actually started paying money. No fake timeline, no VC money and no going viral, just a regular student with $200 of ad budget testing until something works. If you're watching this, it means something worked. Let's build I need to find an app idea, but I'm not trying to invent something revolutionary. I want something that's already proven to work just with a different angle or target market. The goal is to build as fast as possible an MVP, minimum viable product. Basically the simplest version of the app to test if people will actually pay for this. So I go straight to the App Store. I'm scrolling through the top-grossing apps and I notice that Affirmation apps are everywhere. These are literally apps that just show you motivational quotes. One feature, that's it. Perfect for what I want. It's super simple to build, quick to test, no complex feature. I don't know the top three: I am, daily affirmations and daily motivation. They are literally identical. Same quote, same design, same everything. Now here's where it gets interesting. I'll actually be on exchange next semester in those countries and Nordic countries are known to have brutal winters. We are talking about four hours of sunlight per day and huge seasonal depressions. That's my opportunity. Same app concept but actually designed for people going through dark winters. Warm UI, cozy feeling and quotes that acknowledge their reality. So here's my process. I screenshot everything from the IAM app to understand the patterns. Every screen, every flow and holy the onboarding is painful. More than 40 questions. But right after this marathon onboarding they hit you with a three-day free trial pop-up. Just like Duolingo, pay now or start the trial. It's quite smart but aggressive. The app is actually dead simple. Swipe to see and like quotes. Literally TikTok but for affirmations. Then I open Figma. That's where you design apps before coding. I'm dumping all these screenshots in but I'm not keeping all this. The onboarding is way too long for me. I'm keeping maybe 15 screens max. Tomorrow we will actually start designing our app. Yesterday, I mapped out what features I need. Today it's all about design. I want to make this app feel cozy and warm, not a robot sending you those codes. Now you might think I'm wasting time not starting coding right now, but I want to plan everything to know the button size, the screens, the shapes and the colors. My code flows way faster when I know exactly what I want to do. The first thing for inspiration is this website called Dribbble. It's basically Pinterest but for designers. I want to find UI elements I really love and that could match the cozy and warm mood we're going for. So to create my brand and app identity, I need to create a mascot. I'm following this tutorial from Chris Rarock who's a solo app developer who's making those cute little mascots for his apps. And he's recently made a video explaining his whole process creating those mascots with GPT, so I just followed it. ChatGPT suggested me a candle character and I think that's perfect. A little candle that keeps glowing even when everything's dark. That's literally the whole concept of the app. I'm calling him Glow, our little candle friend. Now for the actual UI components. I'm using cloud to help me generate IDs for the color palette, input and button styles. It's not perfect at all but that's also a good base. I'm not a designer so with this I can have a pretty good base to start the coding part. Let the coding begins We'll start by creating the basic structure. For that, I'm opening the terminal and I create a new expo project. All right, I've just set up a new expo project. So here is the blank project. I set up the server so it's running on the simulator. So I'm just following the the basic get started. It's really well made and quite easy to follow you just have to run a few commands and you have your basic app running there. Now the base is created, we need to add all the other features. We won't have any login or sign up on the app because we will store everything on device. That's way easier for us. The only thing that we have to set up right now is notifications, but we won't use a complex system with server backend and so on. The app will work by itself. So even on airplane mode it will work. I'm using Cloud Code to quickly test the notifications just to be sure that it works as expected. So you can send test notifications. You also have them on the notification center just there. And then if you click on them, app it opens the app. Now the fun part: that first onboarding screen. This is so important This is where users decide if they trust your app or delete it. One chance to make them feel welcome. I'm translating my Figma design into React Native code then positioning Glow, our candle mascot right in the center. The mascot animation is key. I want him to do this little bounce when the screen loads like he's excited to meet you. After an hour of tweaking, the first screen is perfect. It feels warm, it feels welcoming, it doesn't feel like every other app. Glow is coming to life. Today's mission is to build the entire onboarding flow and somehow figure out the widgets. Apparently you need to code in native language for widgets so it will be Swift for iOS. I'll only start with iOS for now but I've never used Swift in my whole life so that's gonna be interesting. First, I need to create an animation for when users allow notifications. You know sometimes you hesitate so that's why I want to create an animation to make this whole process about notifications a bit less invasive. I'm using Jitter for this. Think of it as Canva but for animations. They have templates for everything: loading animations, success dates, whatever. I'm taking their notification template and customizing it. Now for the next 3 hours, I coded all the onboarding screens. And honestly, it's just copy pasting components and changing text. Super repetitive. So I'm speed running through this part because I'm just typing the same React Native components over and over. I'm done with the onboarding. I just wanted to quickly show you what it looks like. So this screen was the screen we made yesterday with the animation. Then I ask your name. So whatever. I ask for your age. It will be very useful for analytics. Then how do you identify? So female, male or prefer not to say. Then how do you improve your mental health? That's also for analytics. If I want to add some categories and so on. A screen about the benefits of daily affirmations because you don't necessarily know why and what it is for. The notifications part, so here's the animation we made this morning. I'll just show you again. You can choose how many notifications you want per day and the time, the start and end time. I wanted to create a daily habit thing, a bit like Duolingo, so you have to check the app every day. For retention-based app, it's amazing. Then you can choose the categories. So what type of codes do you want? Then the widgets. It's on your face screen for now because I don't even know how to code widgets. And then the special offer screen exactly like the iam app because if you want to pay now, you can. So that's it for the onboarding. There are lots of screens but actually it's really fast to complete everything. The onboarding is finally done. Now it's time for the unknown: the widgets. So here's the thing about widgets: Expo can do them. So that's going to be pretty fun because I have to write native code and I'm so bad at Swift. But I'm following this tutorial from a guy who explains how to implement those widgets, which is exactly what I need. The concept is actually really simple. A widget is just a tiny app that lives on your home screen. It can do much, just display information and have a few interactions like simple buttons. So for me, that's perfect because I just want to display basic code, so only text. That's probably going to be pretty easy to do. Guys, just look at that. Two widgets. So the first one is the small squared one and a full width one. I've also added the mascot at the bottom left, and it looks like he's looking at the quote. I think it looks really nice. And when you click on it, it just opened the app. So that's really basic. Actually, the widget will fetch a random quote every hour and show it so it will change throughout the day. Today was actually a good day. We implemented so much. We made all the onboarding screens. and the two widgets. Tomorrow's gonna be interesting, I'll try to implement in-app subscriptions with Revenue Cat. And I think I have to buy a new Apple Developer account because my current one is linked to my startup and I want to differentiate them. Today is the expensive day, that's time to actually set up payments because a business without revenue is just an expensive hobby. And I'll start by buying a new Apple Developer account So that should be good. We are just waiting the processing time, it should be a few hours. But we can start the Revenue Cat part right now because that's gonna be a bit long. Let me quickly explain how app monetization works because nobody breaks this down. When someone pays on your app, Apple and Google just take a 30% cut which is huge. But Apple made a small business program which just reduces the 30% cuts to 15%. So you have 85% of the global price left to you. That's where Revenue Cat comes in. They handle all the painful stuff. Recipe validation, subscription status, the whole mess. And it's free if you make a under $2,500 per month, which is perfect for starting out. Setting up Revenue Cat with Apple is a mess. I need to create something called an API key, which is basically a password that lets Revenue Cat talk to Apple. I'm going through Apple's dashboard and I download my key, then I upload it to Revenue Cat. Next, I name my project and add the bundle ID, which is the unique code that identifies it. But before creating it, Apple wants to know everything. Will you use the camera, the localization, and so on? Finally creating the app in App Store Connect with the bundle ID. Then I copy it to Revenue Cat. One more key to upload, the purchase key which is another password specifically for payments. After 30 minutes of back and forth between dashboards, Revenue Cat is finally connected. Now the fun part: creating the actual subscriptions I'm making two options: monthly for $10 and yearly for 40 with a 3 days free trial. That's a huge difference but I want people committing long term. The pricing gets tricky though because I need different prices for Nordic countries. Each country needs its own price point because currencies are different. Now building the actual paywall in the app. What's brilliant about Revenue Cat is they have paywall templates. I chose this clean one with three sections: Hero image at the top where Glow, our mascot will go, testimonials in the middle and pricing cards at the bottom. Once it looks perfect, one click to publish. Now comes the slightly technical part: adding these to my app code. Installing the revenue cat library, adding my API credentials and creating a custom build. I've integrated the payroll on the app so you have the yearly and monthly plan. The yearly has a three days free trial because I think that's way better for conversion. So it's in test mode but you can directly pay there. So that's it for the in-app payments. Now I want to quickly create a super base database because it's getting quite late. I want to store all the data linked to the onboarding and the in-app feedback because I want to have some analytics that will guide me through the iterations. I'm keeping this dead simple: two tables, one for users with onboarding answers and another one for feedbacks like feature requests. So when user finishes onboarding, I just send their choices to Superbase. Tomorrow's mission is finishing all the app content. We're so close to having something real. Today was a marathon, literally eight hours straight of coding to finish every single screen in the app. From the home screen with categories to the settings, the streak tracker and the favorite section. Everything That's the day: the app reveal. So I'll show you exactly what I've added today, everything that I've coded. So first thing first: the swipe feature. You can swipe up and down like TikTok. You can also like the coat by clicking on the heart or double-clicking on the coat. I've also made a cool animation with the mascot at the bottom left so if you click on him he'll do a little jump and wear glasses. So he looks like he's reading the code with you. And if you click again on him, he'll just disappear at the bottom left. I've also added categories. So if you click at the bottom right, you can choose between all the categories. So let's choose the favorites, for instance. I've also added the mix. So if you want to select multiple categories, you can. You just click there and select them and it will create your own mix. And the last thing is all the settings things. So you can see your streak. and modify your name, your gender, and also make a feedback. So if you want to send features request or whatever, that's here. Today was actually an amazing day because I finished the app. I mean, I'm not done yet because I have to submit it to the App Store and maybe they'll reject it. So tomorrow I'll create the different policies and the landing page to submit everything to the App Store. and the process will be between 24 and 48 hours for the review to happen. So fingers crossed for tomorrow, I won't publish that app so bad and if it works first try, that would be amazing. I've created a new Next.js project and honestly, Claude wrote 90% of it. I tweaked the styling and tried to add the exact same look as the app. The whole process is blazing fast when you're not trying to be fancy and I've also made some assets in Figma. Just iPhone mockups with our app screens inside, that's not perfect but it looks professional enough. The landing page is done in one hour. It's very basic, it's purely UI. So you have a little description on the left and a screenshot on the right. I've also made three cards explaining the different features. So the widget, the notification and the categories. That's really basic. I've added two policies. So the privacy policy and the terms of use. Those are mandatory if you want to publish your app because Apple requires them. I've written everything with ChatGPT and it's okay for now because it's the beginning. I've described in details how the app works, but if the app grows, I'll rewrite them with a lawyer. Now the submission part. With Expo it's stupidly simple: EAS build to create the package and EAS submit to send it to Apple. EAS handles all the complicated sign-in certificates and provisioning profiles that used to make developers cry. I'm heading to the airport right now because I have a flight to Bangkok to see my girlfriend. She's there on her exchange semester so I'll spend one month with her. I'll submit the app from the airport so the timing is actually perfect. Apple usually takes 24 to 48 hours to review the app and my flight is in 6 hours. So while I'm in the air, Apple will be reviewing Glow. Wait I forgot the App Store assets. The real pain: screenshots for all the different iPhone sizes. I'm at the airport right now trying to design these in Figma. I used a template with a clean background, screenshots of the app and some explanation text. Nothing fancy but it needs to be done before I can submit. I'm submitting from my gate and when I land, we'll know if we are approved or rejected. Guess who's back? I just landed in Bangkok. I'm in the Chatuchak district right now, which is right in the heart of the city. Check out this view from here, that's beautiful and that will be my new office for the next few weeks. Now the sad part, Apple rejected Glow. That's not a big deal because the issue is so stupid. So in App Store Connect there is this section called privacy where you have to list everything your app collects, name, email, that kind of stuff. But there is a checkbox for each data type asking you if you're using it for tracking purposes, which in Apple language means advertising or reselling these data to third parties. And my dumb ass checked yes on everything without even reading. So Apple thinks I'm building the next Facebook stealing all your data, when really I just store your name to say "Hey Sarah" on the app. The reviewer was actually really nice about it, he just told me there was a mismatch between my privacy policy and what I entered in App Store Connect. And in my case it's pretty simple to fix it, I just have to modify the App Store Connect part So no code to change. The fix takes 5 minutes, unchecking all the tracking boxes and making sure it's now reflecting properly what I'm actually doing with this data. Also adding a comment explaining exactly what changed so the next reviewer doesn't have to dig through everything. And this is actually super common. Most apps get rejected on first submission for tiny things like this: privacy policy mismatch like in my case or forgot to test on iPad or whatever. It's actually Apple's way of keeping quality high. So I'm resubmitting the app right now. See you in 48 hours when hopefully we're actually live. It's been five days, five whole days. I don't know why it took so long but Apple finally reviewed and accepted the app so we're finally live. But right now nobody knows we exist and it's time to change that. First, App Store Optimization or ASO which is basically SEO but for apps. If you don't optimize for the right keywords there is too much competition so you're invisible. For this I'm using this tool called Astro and I'm smiling because that's a pure banger. This tool is exactly what you need to find and spot the right keywords. It will show you for every keyword the competition by country. The strategy is really basic, you need to find popularity above 20 and difficulty under 50. So you can check the keywords used by other apps to have some ideas or just try by hand like asking ChatGPT what would be right keywords for my app and describing your app. And you also have some suggestions here "Health" which means health in Norwegian. The popularity is nearly at 70 and the difficulty is under 50 at 46. So that might be a keyword that I want to keep. Now for the launch strategy, I need users, I need feedbacks and create some initial traction. So I want to try something making the app completely free with a lifetime access of the pro version. No payment, no subscription, just download the app and keep it forever. I won't make any money from this but that's not the point. I really want to have some downloads and some App Store feedbacks to start that initial traction. The next part is leveraging my YouTube community, so that's you guys. I already make tech content on this channel and you guys are literally my first users. So I'm creating YouTube Shorts documenting the whole process exactly like this video but in short formats. I quickly wrote the script in Ocean then recorded my voice and then edited the video in Premiere Pro. I created two different shorts. I post one every 2 days and hopefully we'll get some downloads. So the first few days are crucial. If we can get to 100 downloads and some feedbacks, the App Store will do its algorithm thing and start to show us to more people. I'll probably be back in a few days when we'll get some interesting news. The rhythm's been slower lately, less filming and more analyzing. I wanted to gather some real data before adjusting the strategy. So let me show you where we're at. Current downloads nearly 900 so let's break down the traffic sources. We can see that AppRefer made the most downloads. What is AppRefer? It's simply when an app like Instagram just sent a user to my App Store page and then they download the app. We can see the details by clicking there. WeChat made nearly 200 downloads. WeChat is a chat app used in Asia. A lot of Chinese people use WeChat to chat, and actually I had lots of Chinese downloads so I think someone shared the app on a group or whatever and it drove lots of traffic. Then AppRaven with AppGuns free. It was an old method to promote your app, but I didn't do anything, but I still had traffic. I just checked and I have a page there that's automatically created that drove some traffic and then Telegram and some other apps. I also made one single Reddit post because the other ones got banned. On the productivity app subreddit, I just explained, hey, the app is free for now. Do you want to test it? And I got 10 upvotes and nearly 3000 views. Now YouTube, I make two shorts that got 20,000 views in total. And I put a special link there to really track how many users clicked on the link. Here is the tracking. We got nearly 300 clicks, which is really good. But then when we check in App Store, the web refers, we can see that tap it. So the tool that I use just made 10 downloads. That's actually a really bad conversion for 20,000 views to have only 10 downloads. But that was pretty normal because my audience on YouTube are only developers, so they don't really look for affirmation apps. The last thing is Revenue Cat. If we check non-subscription, that's more than 600 people just claimed their free trial. It doesn't mean that we will have lots of subscriptions after that. It was free, so obviously lots of people claimed it. But I wanted to share it with you. I also got some reviews because at the beginning, the goal of that lifetime free access was to have some traffic and some reviews on the app store. I got eight ratings with two one star review, which makes an average of four out of five. That's actually pretty bad to one star reviews, but whatever. And one of those one star reviews was someone complaining that they couldn't buy premium obviously because the app was free. I don't know why I deserve a one star review for that. Keep in mind that you have to answer those comments. You're not answering to that angry guy. You are actually showing all the future users that you give a shit. I made a straightforward answer explaining, oh sorry for the confusion, it was actually an offer and here's how you can claim your free trial. And maybe when you're really nice in the comments they could change the review but I don't really think so. The app store keywords need work though because I'm getting downloads but retention sucks. Only 15% of users came back day two so people downloaded but expected something else. So I'm tweaking less generic keywords and more specifically. The title now has two to three main keywords and subtitle as supporting ones. This tells Apple exactly who to show the app to. I'm doing this before driving new traffic because I really want good stats on those new specific keywords. Apple ranking system is actually a black box, but we know that they rank apps based on the most recent reviews. So new reviews on new keywords equals higher ranking. From now on, I'm only coding updates based on actual data. I noticed that only two thirds of users actually allow notifications, which kills the whole concept of daily codes. I'm adding a new screen before the permission pop up explaining that notifications are a core feature of the app. And if they still say no, there is another screen after that that will explain them that they're really missing something from the app. And I will obviously measure if this improves the rate. As I said, I'm only coding two things from now: stuff from user feedbacks and improvements to key metrics. My key metrics are simply retention, conversion, and user demographics. The most important one is retention by far because if users log in daily on the app, I won't have any problem to convert them. Now that we know the app works and traffic sources are identified, it's time for the real game: organic content creation. Today is day 18 and that's time to go all in in organic content. For TikTok, I just spent the last few days just warming up the account. It means liking, commenting and interacting with the type of post you want to target. But I didn't post anything because I want the TikTok algorithm to flag me in that niche so when I'll start to post it will know exactly who to show my content to. The key is testing different hooks so only change the beginning of the video just to see which one grabs the most attention and then all in on that kind of video. And the strategy is really simple, we'll post only three formats. The first type is POV videos like "POV you finally found a wellness app for seasonal depression". That kind of video is really easy to make and works pretty well if you can identify your users problems. The second type is product demos like "here's my morning routine with Glow". Here you just want to show your app's features. For me it will be widgets on the home screen, opening the app and swiping through codes. People love seeing apps in action. The third and last one is results or transformation. Like I use this app for three weeks, here's what's changed. It's before and after vibes but targeted for your niche. The plan for the next few days is actually pretty simple but really exhausting. Just create 10 to 20 pieces of content and post 2 to 3 per day. I just want to see what hits and then just iterate and create more content of that kind. It's a numbers game, most will flop for sure but we only need one to pop off. I'm also setting up a link tree that's the link in BioTool everyone uses. One link that leads to the app store also shows everything. Plus it tracks clicks so I know exactly where the traffic comes from. Quick Reddit update: I'm still posting every day on one or two subreddits, and yesterday I posted on the Expo subreddit and the team actually reached out. They want me to write a blog post about the whole process and that's freaking sick As an Expo developer, to be able to write a blog post on their own website feels amazing. I'm also getting emails and DMs from users about what they like, what features they like to see added, and how they're using the app. This engagement is so valuable for truly understanding how to help them the most. This is the grand phase: no more coding unless something's broken. Just creating content, content, and more content. The app works and people like it when they find it, now we need to be sure that they will find it. It's day 22 and I've posted about 15 videos on my TikTok account Only two broke the 2,000 views and that converted to exactly two trial signups and they both cancelled immediately. I'll keep posting because you never know what might randomly blow up but it's time to prepare plan B, paid ads. Right now when someone downloads the app from TikTok, I have no idea where it came from. But TikTok needs to know okay this guy came from this ad or this one to really optimize the ad. So I'm installing the TikTok events SDK, adding tracking codes and making sure it fires when someone installs the app, opens the app and starts a trial. While updating the code, I'm adding the most requested feature: dark mode. I got at least 20 messages asking for it and Glow looks even cuter on dark backgrounds. That part took ages like literally 6 or 7 hours of coding because it was so hard. Let me show you what happened. When you create a campaign in the TikTok Ads Manager, you can select App Promotion and App Install. So TikTok will optimize the campaign to gather the most app installs per dollar spent. You have three choices. The first one is to connect to a mobile measurement partner, which is super expensive, like a few cents per app install, which is way too expensive for me. Or you can select I don't use a mobile measurement partner service, but this won't really work because TikTok won't have enough data or or just data at all to optimize the campaign. The last choice is to use TikTok events SDK, which is not supported by React Native or Expo. So I had to build my own library with native code on top of a broken library. It was super exhausting, but it finally works. I'm submitting the new app version to Apple. The update includes TikTok attribution tracking, dark mode and a clearer onboarding. So everything should be set up. I'll keep posting on TikTok while waiting for our Apple team to review the app. And in the next few days, I'll show you exactly how to set up a TikTok ad campaign. Everything from the video to the different settings. It's day 23 and the app is already accepted by Apple. It went so quick. We will now create the campaign on the TikTok ads manager. The first thing is to explain to TikTok why do you want to spend money on ads? Is it to get views, to get interactions, to get sales? For us, it's app install. So we will switch to the full version. Confirm. And there we can see app promotion and we'll select smart campaign. TikTok will target by itself the best audience. We won't have to set up anything. Then iOS 14 dedicated campaign. We want to only target iOS users because our app is only on iOS app. And let's select the app we created yesterday. So by default, the goal will be click, but we don't want click. We want install then the budget. So how much money do you want to spend per day? At the beginning of this challenge, I told that we will use in total $200 from my money. Daily spend should be at least $50 per day. Here it's in euros so a bit less like 45 euros per day. But because we have so low budget, I'll only use something like 25 to 30 euros. Then the schedule: we won't touch anything because this campaign is a test campaign. It will run for three days to see which creative is the best and then we will put all the remaining money on the last creative. Then there is the audience targeting, so which country do you want to target? In my case it will be Nordic countries, so I'll add three or four of them. Then there is the minimum age. I won't touch this but you can select 18 or 25 years old. I would say that 25 years old should be better but I'm not really sure so I will leave 18. We won't touch anything on placement and then the best part Add generation. That's here that we can add our creatives. I will simply just add video or image and use TikTok posts so the posts that I've made are now listed here and I can select like two of them for instance. Through those creatives, I try to target different parts of the app so one will showcase for instance the widget, one will showcase the notifications and so on. I just forgot to mention one parameter which is languages. Just select your app language so that users you're targeting will speak the language of your app. For me it will be just English. I'm quickly editing three new TikToks to have more samples for the campaign. Then back to the TikTok dashboard to import the post I just made. I'm testing six different videos in this campaign and finally we can click on publish. Hopefully we will make some conversion because with $100 of ads we will get lots of traffic, so fingers crossed And I'll keep you updated if anything happens. Day 24, my ads got approved and ran for one day. But from the logs I'm not sure I'm perfectly sending the TikTok payload for the attribution part. So I'm pausing the TikTok campaign and making a quick update to batch it. Exactly like last time when I implemented that mode, this time I also implement a new feature and this will be themes. So I change a bit the UI on the top left you now have a premium button if you click on it and you're not subscribed the payroll will go down. I also changed the bid to paywall just to show what features you unlock when you pay. The new feature is on the bottom right. It's only a premium feature and you can select a new background for your affirmations. Lots of users ask for it because the other affirmations apps are doing the same, so I just implemented it. And when approved by Apple, I'll just resume the TikTok campaign for the last two days. Today is day 26, I guess. And I have two good news, two really good news. First, I was scrolling on Reddit and I found this post about Apple ads. On the App Store you can pay Apple to make an ad and have better ranking on some keywords. I read the post and I saw in a comments that Apple gave $100 credits so I immediately created an account on Apple ads and a few minutes later I received this email. We've applied your $100 promo credit to your account. I've added a few trending keywords to hopefully rank on them, but it's free credit so we'll see what happens. The second good news is on TikTok ads. I've created a new account for this challenge and I saw this thing get up to 6,000 USD as credit for new accounts. The offer is pretty simple: if you spend $200 they'll give you $200 in ad credits. So in total with Apple, we will have $300 of credits by only spending $200, which is amazing. That's $500 in total. Really good news for today. It's day 31. I'm finally back in France and today I wanted to show you the TikTok ads results because I have all the data. As you'll see, results are really bad but you have to keep running your ads for at least three days because TikTok algorithm works really well but you have to give him time. If you cut it too early, It won't have time to really target the right audience and show your ad to the right people. Here are the results. You can post the video if you want to check in details, but what matters is the budget. So I spent 30 euros every day. I got nearly 100 downloads per day. I have a trial to paid ratio really low, even 0%. 10 people started the trial, but nobody paid. And due to that really low conversion from trial to paid, our gross profit is really bad. We lost nearly 80%. every money we spent nearly 60 euros. So something like 55 and we spend 60 euros in total that really low conversion is due to the fact that people start a trial but then don't see the real value because they can sell their trial something like two or three minutes just after starting it and I'm not lying on the onboarding or during the paywall. So I think they don't see the value. That's why I want to change two things. During the onboarding, I'll ask more questions to really target the users and create a for you section in the app to recommend some categories based on your answers during the onboarding. And I also create a tutorial. So when you finish the onboarding, you'll have a few screens explaining how the app works and how to change categories and so on. I'm done coding the new onboarding and the for you sections. So I'll just show you how it looks as before. You have different questions during the onboarding. What's your name? How old are you? What's your gender and so on then you'll have some more personal questions that I use to really target the user and try to recommend the best categories that will match his mood or current situations. Finally, I finished the onboarding. Now the tutorial starts. So welcome to Glow, I'll show you around and help you get started. The goal of this tutorial is just to show the category button and how it works. I made a bouncy animation to make the user tap on the category badge. As you can see there is a new section called "For You" which contains four categories. So let's select growth. Don't forget to install the widgets. And that's all for him. And now the whole UI appears. So that's how I actually onboard users now trying to explain the features. At the top, I added a like goal because I want users on their first session to really use the app to understand everything in it. It's really basic so you can understand everything in one minute. I submitted the app to AppReview two hours ago and it's already accepted by Apple. It went really quick. So I resumed the TikTok campaigns. I mean, I didn't resume it. I created a new one because I want to have a new learning phase with that new app, with the new onboarding and tutorial. to wait again for three days with a 30 euros daily budget. And this morning, I also created this analytics dashboard with cloud code to keep track of the key metrics like revenue per install, download to trial. And if we check the detailed view, we can see screen per screen during the onboarding where users quit the app. So I really know which screen should be removed or kept. I'll keep you updated in a few days, maybe when the TikTok ad campaign will have enough learning to be relevant. Today is day 32 and I was just thinking about what would happen if I translated all the ads in native languages. Because for now, all my ads and even the app is in English. But I'm targeting countries that don't speak natively English. For instance, let's say Norway, they speak Norwegian. What would happen if the ad was in Norwegian? And the second part of the question is what would happen if the app was translated to Norwegian? Would we have more conversion in-app? And through the ad, we already spent half the budget during the test campaign and now we resumed it for three days. So it will be the other 100 euros left. But I really want to test it. I received some direct messages through Reddit, some emails and some comments on YouTube asking about specific parts of developing a mobile app. And I thought about creating a Discord somewhere where I could share some resources about the idea, how to validate it, the design, the development and even the marketing part. Exactly like this video. The goal is also to talk every day about your project, where you're at and how we could help you. Maybe someone went through the exact same thing and could help you to debug, to create a better paywall or even to create some better ads. There will be a small onboarding with a few questions. Where are you in your app journey? So let's say currently building then what's your current MRR status? So not launched yet and. What do you need the most help with? Let's say marketing and growth. And when you arrive, it will give you different roles and people will be able to help you. And I've created different categories. So they're getting started the community one, the roadmap where I'll explain everything step by step to launch your own mobile app. And then the journey again, step by step, the idea, the design, the development, the paywall and monetization and the marketing and growth of the community will be able to talk there. and exchange the different tips, the different news, and we'll grow together. So if you want some help, motivation, and join a community, just join the Discord and we will spend time together. That's going to be pretty fun and we will learn a lot. I won't teach you how to make $1 million through your app because I never did. The goal is just to share knowledge and help each other to build a few thousand dollars per month app and just have fun through learning. Today is the end of day 34 and I have a really nice news. We've made nearly $160 by spending only 30 euros on ads. I resumed the campaign three days ago and I've only had three days free trial, so users converted today. The key learning is that trying to improve your onboarding can have a huge impact on sales. Talking about ads, I've spent nearly all the budget, so I spent 180 euros, six days at 30 euros per day. And as I told you, there is a TikTok promotion, that gave me 180 euros of free credits. If I spent 180, they actually gave me 172, which is nearly 180 for the next five to six days. We will only run on free credits for my ads, which will cost nothing and will be only profit. Talking about conversion, here is my user journey funnel for the 21st. And I think I can improve it just a bit because right now only 76% of people who installed the app completed the onboarding And that seems a bit low. I want to make it 80 or 85%. That way we will have more payroll shown and then probably more conversion at the end. I looked for tips online, and I found this article on Revenue Cat website which just explains how to fix your funnel. And from this article, there are two key things I want to implement to hopefully improve again the onboarding. The first thing is called commitment psychology, and it's used in apps like Flow. or Jolingo and headway where they ask you to commit. So just like here, tap to commit, committing to goals, boost motivation. And apparently doing this just before showing the payroll can improve dramatically the payroll conversion. So I'll add that. And I've also seen on these screenshots at the bottom right there, that there is a completion bar during the onboarding that I can see. completely missed. In my onboarding, users don't really know where they're at and adding this can really improve it. At least I think so. We will try that. I'll show you what I've implemented. So the first thing is the progress bar. You can now see at the top there is a progress bar that will fill during the onboarding, a regular thing that everyone thinks about, but I literally forgot to edit. And I think just that can really improve the onboarding completion. We will see tomorrow after I submit this app to AppReview. Now the commitment part, I literally copy pasted the example from Revenue Cat. So it looks like that. I, Arthur, will use Glow to feel more self-confident. And if you hold your finger, the fingerprints behind will just fill. And at the end, it shows the paywall. It's a three steps paywall. So it's really important during the onboarding that you show only one information per screen. The first one is only explaining that we offer three days free trial. The next one is there will be a reminder of the paywall. one day before and the next one, what you will get by subscribing. It's really important to explain to the user what you will get if you pay for it. And don't create one paywall with all this information. Just create different screens. That's really important because users won't read everything and they could miss an information. That's it for the onboarding. I built the app and send it to AppReview. And tomorrow we will see if the onboarding completion is just a bit better. Let me show you a quick tip. I was submitting my app to App Store Connect submitting my build to just add it to the App Store. But I'm using EIS submit and I'm only a free user, so I'm on the free tier queue, which is really long, sometimes one hour, sometimes even two hours. I looked for an alternative and there is this app called Transporter. It's an app from Apple. You just open it and sign in with your Apple account. Take the build you made and drag and drop the file on the Transporter app. At the end, you just have to click on the deliver button and this build will be sent to App Store Connect in something like five minutes. So you just skip the whole EIS queue, which is way faster if you're only submitting to App Store and not Play Store. With the end of day 35 and today we gained two new paying customers for a total of The new app version with the new onboarding got approved last night and it had a huge impact on onboarding completion because today we are at 83% and yesterday we were at 74%. So hopefully this trend will continue in the next few days. Also today, we got 10 premium purchases, which means that 10 users started a free trial. That's pretty good that I spent only 180 euros in that spend because it's approximately $200. So that's going to be way better for me to just track. everything in dollars. Today is day 36 and we made $164 of revenue. That's four new paying customers. Here is the user journey funnel for today, and we can see that onboarding completion went down just a bit. So I'll wait a few days to see if the trend continues or not. Talking about onboarding in the next few days, I'm going to test lots of things. I'll keep the ads running because it's driving really good traffic to the app. more than 200 downloads per day. But I think our stats are still a bit low. We could increase onboarding completion, but also really increase trial start rates. which is still really low. I'll try different things to improve the onboarding, like different messages, different screen orders, different paywalls. And when the combination seems pretty good, we will just increase ad spend to drive more revenue. From now on, the formula is pretty simple. Just try to improve the onboarding to drive more conversion and then spend more on TikTok ads to obviously make more revenue. To A/B test my different paywalls, I'm using the experiments feature from PostHog. I just created a new experiment. called onboarding. I created four variants, which is no pact. So I removed one specific screen, the full onboarding, obviously one with a bit less questions and another one with less questions, but at a different spot. And then you have to specify what kind of metrics do you want to track? I set it up two metrics, the onboarding completion rate and the onboarding conversion rate. That means that when new users arrives on the app, you will get a random variance. For instance, no pacts We will measure if he completes the onboarding and converts during the onboarding. With a huge pool of users, we're going to have lots of results and we will be able to measure which variant is the best. And that's going to be the one that we will pick for production later. Day 46, long time no see, but it feels really good because the last days were really interesting. I think my work starts to pay off. That's the part I love the most. You see some traction, so it seems it kind of works. You just... test new things through Abitest, then you gather some data, some feedbacks and then iterate on it. And that's the same cycle you have to repeat again and again. And really small changes like just swapping a few screens during onboarding can have a huge impact on your trial start rate or just revenue. I didn't run any ads during four days because I waited Apple review team to review the new app with the Abitest for the onboarding. And it got pretty long because the app got rejected the first time. So I had to submit it twice. During that time, I had a few trials through organic conversions. So one or two per day, which is a really really good sign. Now, let me show you how the ABI test looks like in post-hug. In a few days more than 300 people went through the onboarding and went through the ABI test. I had four variants: the control which is the basic onboarding flow, one without a specific screen, one with less personal questions and one without a few specific screens about personal plan. My primary metric was just onboarding completion, and we can see that the NOPAC variant was really better than the three other ones. And then if we look at onboarding conversion, so who started the trial through the onboarding process, we can see that again, the NOPAC is really better, but the less personal. So when I removed a few questions about you, like how do you feel right now and so on drove no conversion. So just three screens removed drove no conversion. And that's why you have to happy test because really small changes can change everything for your conversion and revenue. So these variants seems to be the best one. This is my App Store Connect page. And yesterday, I received a very cool email. Let me show you in the payments and financial reports. We got for the Amazing. Quick clarification on the challenge rules, because I said that I only use $200 of my own money for TikTok ads. And that's still true. I haven't spent a single dollar more than that. But the other thing with app revenue, when someone buys a subscription, I don't actually get the money right away. Apple holds it for 30 to 45 days before paying me out. So let's say I've made 50 euros from the app this week. This money exists and it's mine. but I can't touch it yet. So I'm just sitting there waiting while my ads could be running. What I did is basically I loaned myself the money. I fronted it from my own pocket temporarily, knowing that it's coming back when Apple pays out. This cash flow problem is actually so common that Revenue Cat announced they are building a feature to fix it. So they would do exactly what I'm doing to myself, but with their own money and they would take a percentage, obviously like a tax on the revenue you made, but they would give you the money instantly. Anyways, I just wanted to be transparent. Now let me show you the RevenueCat dashboard, what it looks like. Currently we have 22 active trials and 37 active subscriptions. Our MOO is only at $143 but our revenue is nearly $1,500. I think I'm going to keep this challenge going until we hit $2,000 in profits not revenue in one single month. I'm going to keep testing for at least one week because I want to be test prices, paywalls and finish the onboarding test. But honestly it's getting repetitive and I think the core lesson is done from here is just scaling. So doing the exact same thing but just with bigger numbers, bigger ad spends so bigger revenue and reinvest reinvest and reinvest. I'll show you how to make $2,000 of profit per month but continuing feels like more of the same. Let's get back to the intro. Interesting things. I'm going to show you my current payroll, which is this one. It looks like that. And I just show you how your free trial works. This one works pretty well from my statistics and I've created a second variance, which is the claim variance. It's really similar, but, the, the box here changed and I just copied this one from this video from SuperRule. SuperRule is exactly like Revenue Cat, but they have a really cool podcast where they show everything about apps and interview different people. And I copied this paywall. Let me show you how it looks because I thought it looked really nice and could really fit our onboarding. I'm going to ABI test the paywall too, and to ABI test with RevenueCat, you just go to the experiments tab, create a new experiment so you can name it, then select the experiment type. This one is going to be a paywall design. You choose the primary metric which is initial conversion rate, enrollment criteria, everyone. And then you select the two variants you want to ABI test and RevenueCat will just exactly like post-hug send different paywalls to different users and measure the impact. This morning I discovered a new TikTok ads feature. I just wanted to show you. I've made a basic script, which just analyze the trial repartition on every day. It looks like that. So I store all my RevenueCat data on my computer the different trial distribution by hour with my current time zone. And that way I can see when I'm converting the most and knowing that when you go on TikTok ads on the budget and schedule part, you can go to more option and select specific time of the day. I've selected the best time for me. And that way my ads are only running on those times, which should maximize the conversion. That's a quick tip. I found that I'm not really sure it that works. But I thought that was pretty smart to test. And the last thing I want to show you, which is Apple ads. I don't know what I did wrong, but it's not working and it's not spending any money. I've tried different CPT bid and I think I just have to wait. Maybe my keywords aren't very smart. I don't know. But I got only four downloads or now this is not working. I mean, that was free money, so we don't care. But yeah, that's not the best strategy I ever tried. That's it for today. I showed you lots of things. I'm going to keep the ads running and I really want to just reach the $2,000 of profits for the last 28 days. I'm going to keep updating you and show you how it goes. Hey, so today is day 49 and I wanted to change a bit because in the last few days I worked a lot for school. That's soon the Christmas holidays and I have lots of homework about my internship and some papers to do. So I wanted to dedicate a few hours today to ship a new feature. The feature is pretty basic. It's called practice, and you want to have some voice reading some affirmations for you in a story like UI. That's pretty simple. Let's go coding. To create this feature, I'm going to use a model called a text-to-speech model because I want to give some AI model some text, like the affirmation text, and I'm going to have back some audio file containing a robot just reading the text I gave him. Every day when you open the app, I'm going to download the last audio files from Superbase that are generated with the Gemini API. I was submitting my app to AppReview and I wanted to show you one small setting that I changed a few days ago on App Store Connect that literally made me some money. So when you go in subscriptions, you have the billing race period. And actually this was switched off. I made it to three days billing problem like the credit card didn't work or any kind of problem. Apple will just try again to charge the credit card in three days and during that time, the customer just keep the premium or free trial and that's just how it works. So when sometimes the billing isn't working for whatever reason, it just tries to charge again one day after and another day after. Just switching this on made me three or four new subscriptions which is amazing because... I did nothing more. It just tried to charge again when there was some error. Also, I changed the name to be even more explicit so now it's Glow Daily Affirmations and nothing more. Talking about keywords let me show you how Astro looks like currently. My rankings are getting better every day but i'm still not perfect at all and in some countries like Denmark i'm pretty good that's why i have some natural downloads every day because my rankings are getting better every day I also ended the onboarding ABI test on post hoc, and that's the no pack version that got the most conversions. So that's the one that I kept on my own botting. For instance, yesterday we got 136 downloads and 17 free trials started, which is pretty good. That means that 12.5% of. of users that installed the app, started a trial. And currently today we only had 29 downloads, but we have six new trials started, which is a 20.6% conversion rate from all the people who downloaded the app, which is even better. The onboarding looks pretty good. I'm really happy with those results and I'm just going to keep updating and trying to improve it even more until the Christmas holidays. I'm submitting the new app to AppReview And I really hope this new feature will drive even more trials. We're going to see. I'll keep you updated, obviously. Today is day 54 and we've made three conversions so far. So that's more than $120 for one single day. And yesterday was my best day so far. I've made seven conversion in one single day, which is just impressive actually. And that's more than $278. I don't know if you remember, but a few weeks ago when I tried organic marketing, I've made different posts on Reddit and one on the Expo subreddit. And I've had the Expo team commenting and just said, oh, you could wrote an article about the widgets that could be really interesting. And guess what? Yesterday, really late at night in France, the article went out. So I have my own article on the Expo blog, which is crazy again. I just talk about how I implemented widgets. It's pretty basic article, but still really cool. And the Expo team was so cool. They even sent me a free t-shirt and obviously I asked for an internship. We never know. I've also started the experiment. So to test different payroll variants here is how it looks so far. The B variant is apparently the best one so far. I'm going to wait again more than 50 conversion per paywall to know which one is the best, apparently that's what Revenue Cat records. Also, here is the current dashboard. So our current stats revenue nearly $2,100 looking pretty good. And talking about Abitest, I also learned a few days ago that you could Abitest your app store front page. So that's on App Store Connect on product page optimization. And you can create a test. I'd like to only test the app icon. Apparently it can have a huge impact. So let's see. I've made three, four tests. I'm just going to create the test. I mean, I'm not sure about that one, but you know what? Let's test. Tomorrow, I'd like to show you the different TikToks videos that I've made so you can see what worked and what didn't. Day 55. So first thing first, the Revenue Cat dashboard. We have 39 active trials, 61 active subscriptions and 2,400 revenue in the last 28 days. And today I wanted to show you the different activities. ads that I ran and which one worked the best. Let me show you my TikTok. So I tried lots of formats, really lots of them. The one that worked the best in terms of cost per click, so the one that cost me the less to have one download was this one at less than 10 cents per download, which is crazy good. It looks like that. There is a rhythmic music and a default iOS wallpaper with the earth and the sun moving around it. depending on the time of the day. This one worked really well too. I just took a video from YouTube and added the exact same thing with the earth just after it, with another trendy music. And the last format which worked also pretty well was this one. I actually paid a girl $20 per video and she made three videos of five seconds. It worked really well because it's TikTok native format like vertical screen and so on. I tried really lots of different formats, even Pinterest videos like glow up in one month. These formats work crazy well, like the cost per click is freaking low, but I couldn't get downloads after the click. So my app isn't what people were waiting for after clicking on it. But if you have a glow up app, just try these formats. That's freaking amazing. It works so well. I tried different type of Pinterest glow up things and all All of them worked really well with a very low cost per click. So try it by yourself if you have an app matching that kind of format. Tomorrow, I'll make different videos to just show you step-by-step exactly how to set up the subscriptions, how to set up App Store Connect dashboard and Revenue Cat and everything. The different setups can be really tricky sometimes. So that's why I'm really happy with what I'm building because I'm sure it will help you. And I think I'm going to create a new app from scratch, especially for the Discord. Because I want to build with you so we will be all together starting from scratch or from different steps. I think that can be really interesting. I'm really hyped by all this and start again a new app with other community. That's going to be pretty sick. I bought the AppSprint domain name and in a few days I'll create a very basic landing page for all of that to look pretty clean. Day 56. Let's start with Revenue Cat 0. Maybe just TikTok ads. I had this new coupon, like 100 euros for free again. I think TikTok ads really wants to keep their customers. So they offer you lots of free ad credits at the beginning. And then when you start spending, they stop to give you free ad credits. But we had again, 100 euros of free ad credits, which is approximately something like $115. Crazy good. Again, we won't spend that much on ads. I mean, We used lots of credits, but it wasn't that expensive. Then for the Revenue Cat part, here is the current dashboard. So we are at 46 trials, 66 active subscriptions and the revenue is nearly 2600. Today I also filmed some parts of the course. So I filmed this one about how to set up your revenue cap dashboard, how to set up your App Store Connect dashboard, how to link them because it could be quite challenging. So I'm uploading all of that to YouTube, the Discord for you to have access to it. So yeah, pretty good day. The revenue is steady like every day we have between five and seven, eight conversion, which is amazing. We have a really, really good download to trial conversion. Let me show you today. Okay. we had 50 downloads, 50 onboarding completed. Amazing And 8 conversions, 8 trials started. So that means that we have a 16% conversion from download to trial, which is again really nice. I think we might have the sweet spot. The onboarding is pretty good. The payroll is pretty good. Everything Yeah, everything seems to work. Today is day 57 and that might be our last day together because I think we hit our threshold of $2,000 of profit. Right now we are at $2,800 of revenue in the last 28 days and I think it's a bit more than the $2,000 of profit. So let me create a notion and show you all the different stats, our current conversion rate, our current trial rate and everything so you know in details where we at. I've made three lines. The green one is the profit, the blue one, the revenue, and the red one, the ad spent. The revenue is simply the money that users paid. The profit is the revenue minus Apple cut, which is 15% minus ad spent. So that's actually the money left in my pocket at the end. We've made a really good profit because I had lots of free credits on ads at $35 per day so that would have been a $700 of ad spent but I had two coupons on the TikTok Ads dashboard so two times they gave me free credits the first time $210 and the second time $150 so nearly half the ad spent was actually free credits from TikTok and I also spent $60 for the three videos to pay the girl on TikTok and yeah I have my different videos. I think the best things to remember from this experiment is just only optimize your onboarding, try to spend nearly 90% of your time on the onboarding. Just try to improve every step, every conversion during the onboarding, because that's where all the money is left, like more than 80% of conversions or during the onboarding so work on that. Trust me, that's way more important than the app itself. That seems crazy, but yeah. That's the case and switch on the grace period. I mean, I had lots of money coming from that nearly 10% of the revenue is coming from that. So trust me, turn on that just grace period. You'll gain some money now with the interesting numbers. My current download to trial rate is in average more than 14%. And my trial to pay rates is a bit more than 31%, which is also pretty good. So that means that if I have 100 downloads. I will have 14 trials started and at the end, 4 trial conversions. I'll earn $164 for 100 downloads. That means that for every download, I earn $1.64. I also wanted to show you my different reviews. I have 55 ratings in total with like good ones. I got premium for free because on the Reddit campaigns, I offered those but Yeah, some really, really nice ratings. We are currently at 4.7 out of 5, which is quite good. So I'm happy with that. If you watch this video so far, I'm pretty sure that you have an idea of any kind of project sitting in the back of your head. Maybe a nap, maybe a website or something completely different, like creating a wooden table. It actually doesn't matter. And I know what you're thinking because I was there too. Like, I don't know enough. I start later, but that's not the right mindset. I've built things that nobody used. I spent lots of money on things that didn't work. I tried and failed a lot, but that's exactly how I learned. I didn't know anything. I started something, learned in the process, failed, learned from that failure. And again and again, learning by doing and failing is actually the best way of learning. And don't try to build anything just for the result. Like if you want to be rich or create something, I don't know, revolutionary, don't work only for the result. Trust me. You have to enjoy the whole process, enjoy learning, enjoy failing because you'll spend lots of time just in the process and spend a little, little time at the end like at the result. So if you want your life to be enjoyable, trust me, you have to enjoy the process. Try to fall in love with learning because at the end, I truly think that that's the only way to make it sustainable and worth it. All right, that's it. See you in the next one.
