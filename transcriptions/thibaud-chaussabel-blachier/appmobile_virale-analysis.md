Listen, the rumors are true. There is a seven step formula that gives you the highest chance of building a successful mobile app or SaaS of your very own. This is the fastest way to go from zero to full time app founder income because these seven steps remove any guesswork from your decision making process. Now let me let you in on a little secret. 95% of people fail at building a successful mobile app before they even launch. It's because they think building software or a mobile app is extremely difficult and expensive. They believe they need to be technical geniuses or hire massive development teams to get it done. And look, these approaches might work if you have unlimited cash, you're very tech savvy, you have all the time in the world, and you have access to the top talent. But let's be honest, most of us don't. We're limited with time, resources, coding experience, and we're worried about hiring the wrong developers. And I've been there and done that. I've made all the mistakes. I've wasted a ton of money building apps. I've hired the wrong developers who have scammed me and left me with a terrible product. I've spent countless hours building the wrong products that I didn't validate and had no demand. And after all the trial and error, the back and forth, the years of tinkering and building mobile apps since 2015, I have developed this very simple framework that helped me scale PuffCount to $44,000 a month and monthly recurring revenue, hit over 10 million downloads with a viral app called Wordle, and scale my latest project posted to over $700,000 in total revenue in less than one year. And guess what? I didn't write a single line of code for any of these apps. And my failures as a young kid are the exact reason I started my YouTube channel in the first place and I started sharing all of my knowledge because I had no one to look up to in the app space when I was just a young lad in his bedroom at his parents' house, tinkering away trying to build apps that I thought were cool. And posting on YouTube and sharing my experience and sharing my journey changed my life, but not only mine, countless others who have been watching my content, digesting the information, and building apps of their very own. Like Simon, who took his note-taking app to over $20,000 a month using the exact same framework that I used to build mine. Or Rick, who has been building apps for a long time and just recently scaled to over $2 million in total revenue with his app portfolio. Or Vince, who started watching my content, implemented the strategies, and tripled his revenue with his app portfolio. Or like Rikki, who had a solid design background but she had no idea how to use those skills to build an app and actually get it to market. Again, no coding required, she was able to launch her app as well. And look, building apps isn't just about making a ton of money and being able to travel the world and have all this freedom. While that's great, it's a byproduct of building something that you think is cool and something that will ultimately help people. I've been featured in The Washington Post, Rolling Stone, ABC News. for mobile apps that I built in the past. And that app allowed me to donate to a charity in my hometown. And again, here's the thing. I didn't write a single line of code for any of these apps. I simply outsourced my weaknesses and I focused on what I was good at. So getting back to the framework, by choosing the wrong approaches, you're setting yourself up for failure. That is exactly why 95% of people who try to build an app fail before they even launch. And some of these people that I've spoken to have spent Years of their lives, tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to build some super complex app without launching it onto the store and getting any feedback at all. They get stuck in this constant loop of building new feature here, new feature there, and they never actually launch anything. You know what the problem is? They started off on the wrong foot from day one. So if you don't want to be like 95% of the people out there who fail from day one, you need to pick an approach that plays into your strengths rather than highlights your weaknesses. And I think we can all agree that trying to become a master programmer or a master designer overnight is not the path to building a successful mobile app. And the majority of these approaches and thought processes are just bad. Things like learning how to code from scratch, I know because I've tried it. Things like hiring super expensive development agencies, and again speaking from experience, I've tried it. Or trying to build some super complex product with a million features that no one's ever seen before and you get stuck in this endless loop of building and building and building for years that's like trying to build a rocket ship as a kindergartner here's what people don't realize quite yet with the new ai design and development tools the cost to build a software has never been cheaper and you can get it done so much faster than before there is a proven blueprint for building and scaling apps that anyone can follow and you don't even need a completely unique idea so let me give you some perspective 10 years ago when i first started building apps if you wanted to get a decent app built it would cost you tens of thousands of dollars but today with AI design tools, vibe coding platforms, and access to global top talent on sites like Upwork, you can get a solid app built for under $3,000. And look, the reality is that most successful apps nowadays are just variations of already existing ideas with better execution and better marketing. Instagram was a better version of photo sharing. Uber is a better way to call a taxi. TikTok is a better version of Vine. So the question isn't how do I come up with the next billion dollar idea? The real question is how do you take an already proven idea and execute on it better than anyone else in - That is exactly what I did with Puff Count, the app that I scaled to $44,000 in monthly recurring revenue. I saw a shift from cigarettes to vapes and guess what? There were only a few very small quit vaping apps, if any at all. A majority of the big players in that game were apps to help you quit cigarettes. So I knew that with speed, the right execution and the right marketing, I could make a huge dent in that market with Puff Count. I put together the exact seven step formula that will guide you through the entire process of building your first profitable app. And if you execute on these ideas correctly, there is a very high probability that you will build a successful app business. So now let me walk you through each one of these steps and exactly how they work. Step number one: find a validated idea. The easiest way to start and the way I always start building products is I start by solving a problem for myself. With Puff Count, me and my friends got addicted to vaping in college. With Posted, I struggled to find content creators to hire for my previous businesses. Every new business that I built solves a problem for me myself, because I know if I have the problem more likely than not, other people in the world have that problem as well. You don't need to come up with some crazy new brilliant idea that no one's ever heard about before. That's actually a red flag and a sign that no one really want that. And it's okay if the idea already exists. Most of the successful businesses out there are just iterations on ideas that were built before. So once you've identified a problem that you can solve for people Then you can go over to Sensor Tower and you can search for other apps in this niche or similar to yours. And this is also great if you don't have an idea or you don't have a problem to solve for people, because what you can do is you can filter by the most profitable apps and you want to look for apps making anywhere above $50,000 per month. You can look at the top health apps, the top productivity apps, the top finance apps, the top education apps. These niches especially are gold mines because more likely than not, the apps in these niches are solving problems for people they're experiencing right now. So let me show you exactly how I do this and how I do effective market research on the top earning apps in the space. You go over to a simple website called Sensor Tower, and Sensor Tower will show you exactly how much these apps are making. So for example, when I had the idea for PuffCount, the first thing I did was went over to Sensor Tower, and I searched for other apps related to quit smoking or quitting an addictive habit. And I came to find that there were a bunch that were crushing, doing $90,000 or $100,000 or $300,000 plus per month in monthly recurring revenue. Bingo We have now just validated our idea. We know that there is a market for our mobile app. It's always good to have competition in the app space because you know that people out there are willing to pay for an app like yours. And even generally, in the health and wellness space, I saw that apps were crushing. So I knew if I built an app in that general space, I would do well. I found apps like MyFitnessPal doing $10 million per month or Calm, the meditation app, doing $8 million per month. And again, do not be scared of the competition because your total addressable market But everyone out there willing to pay for your app is everyone with one of these. Everyone with a phone, the smartphone, billions and billions of people. I don't care how big your largest competitor is. There are more people who do not know your competitor exists. You don't need to reinvent the wheel. You just need to reinvent a slightly better wheel or a slightly different wheel. What features or small little quirks are your competitors not doing? What are they not using? Are they marketing well? Are they using short-form content market? There are always gaps. from competitors in your space. And for Puff Count, I wasn't trying to invent a completely new way of quitting nicotine. I was doing very similar stuff that other apps are doing in the space. There is a scientific method to quit nicotine. You slowly reduce your usage over time. I just built a unique way to visualize that and track it in a mobile app. And the key insight is I was way better at marketing because the honest truth is a lot of these apps that are crushing on the App Store right now, they're built by older teams and massive companies who aren't taking advantage of short-form content. and the opportunity to go viral at any given moment. So step one, in a nutshell, is very simple. Find a profitable niche, find a profitable idea by doing market research and plan to build a better version of that product and plan to do marketing better. Step number two, you need to validate the demand for this idea. Even though you've already found a profitable niche and you may have a profitable idea on your hands, you still want to validate that people want your specific approach to solving this problem. So the answer for validating demand is doing research More market research so that you can make sure that your product has a potential to go viral and do well on social media. Because that's the cheat code right now. The biggest differentiator in this space, because building apps has become so easy, is distribution. An easy way to validate demand is to go over to Google Trends and you can type in keywords related to your niche. For example with Puff Count I typed in "quit vaping" on Google Trends and I saw that the graph was up and to the right. This means that more people are searching for a solution to my problem on Google. This is a very, very green signal. Second... little cheat code here. You can check your competitors' app store reviews and you can filter them by the lowest reviews and see what those apps are missing. Understand why their customers are upset. What features did they not have in their app? You will find golden little nuggets in these bad reviews that can turn into to highly profitable features and marketing points for your next app. And third, the most important part of validating demand is going on to social media like TikTok or Instagram Reels, searching for keywords in your niche and identifying viral videos in your niche related to your product. If people are consistently going viral by making content around your app in general or the niches related to your app in general, this is such a positive signal because you know that you can recreate those videos, take inspiration from those videos, and you can make viral content yourself. And this is the number one way that apps are growing right now. Look at the top apps or charts. More likely than not, you're going to see an app at number one or in the top 10 that has recently gone viral on short-form content. It's the strategy right now and it's the easiest way to get your app off the ground and make a life-changing amount of money because all it takes is one viral video to change your business overnight. So the key here is to validate demand before you build anything. It will save you so much time, so much headache, and so much cash. Step number three, design a high converting app. user interface. And this is where AI starts to change the game a lot because previously you either needed to be a killer designer or you needed to hire someone who was amazing at doing UI design. But nowadays you can get a design done in minutes by using AI. You need to draw a sketch of your app and what you think it should look like. And then you can head over to a tool like Stitch from Google or Figma's new AI, and you can upload that sketch into these AI tools and you can get a high quality design built for you. with AI. You can go back and forth with these AI tools and continue prompting until your design is perfect, or you can export these designs, add them into Figma, and you can make changes manually yourself. And this will give you a very decent design in less than 30 minutes. Five years ago, this would have taken weeks and thousands of dollars. But look, don't start there because depending on your design skills and how far AI can get you, you can also run a contest on 99designs, which is still to this day, even with the AI tools, something that I always do. And these can be used hand in hand. 99designs and AI can be used together as I'm about to show you. With 99designs, you can take your sketches or your AI wireframes and you can run a design contest. And for a couple hundred bucks, you can get designers to compete to make the best UI for your app and you only pay for your favorites. 99designs is an absolute cheat code. I still use it to this day even though there are killer AI tools out there. This is exactly what I did for PuffCount and how I found my winning UI design. And to be honest, It was beautiful and way better than anything I could have ever built myself. Now look, the reason that you need to take your time with the design phase is because the design is so, so crucial to the success of your app. Think about it. When you first download an app and you see some crappy design, you're not going to trust it that much. No way are you going to spend money on an app like that. If your design is high quality, polished, and the user feels like this was built by someone who took their time, they're going to trust you even more. And the design is the first thing the user is going to see in their first experience with your app. So make it high quality and make sure it's good. A professional well done design can easily triple or quadruple your conversion rates. For example, in Puff Count I had a crappy hard paywall at the beginning and when I updated the design of that paywall and made it much more clean, it tripled my conversion rate from non-paying users to paying users. Design is so, so, so important. Step number four, once we have our designs, we are going to build an MVP as fast as possible. And this is where so many people get stuck. because they think they need to build some complex app with all the features, and it needs to be perfect before they launch their MVP. Do not do that. You're going to launch a simple MVP with one feature. You're gonna launch it as quick as possible. This will save you time, this will save you money, and you will get a product out into the market that can start making money from day one. And then you can always make changes afterwards. When you're building an app, it's never done. It's like fashion. So your MVP is never going to be the final version that millions of millions of people see. No, we want to get a simple version out there as fast as possible, so that we can start getting feedback from the market, and we can start generating revenue to pull in and use for future updates. And now with AI tools, vibe coding platforms, cursor, cloud code, you can get most of the app done yourself. You can get 80% of the way there. And again, do not let vibe coding or anything scare you because if you want to hire a developer, you can also get that done very, very cheap. Because now instead of hiring three developers, you give one developer cursor and he does three times the amount of work. AI, whether using it directly or not, has completely changed the game for building software. So you have a couple options here. Option number one, you can open up your vibe coding tool of choice. Lovable is great. Builder.io is great. Cloud Code is great. Study them all and pick your favorite because what I've come to find is that vibe coding tools are different for every person. Every person has their own tool of choice. For me, builder.io is killer because I'm a visual guy. I like to build things visually and I think builder.io does that the best for me personally. So study all the vibe coding tools figure out which one is your favorite, and then you can vibe code a simple MVP. And the key here is to keep it very simple. You don't need to worry about the super complex stuff that the vibe coding tools - And get done for you, because we can simply take that MVP that we vibe coded, push into GitHub, give it to a developer and pay them a couple hundred bucks to finalize off all the complex features or stuff we couldn't get done originally ourselves. This is exactly how I built one of my smaller SaaS products, Viral Ad Library. Option number two, you can use a no code builder, a drag and drop Shopify-esque type of app builder like Bubble or Flutter Flow. These ones are awesome too, a little bit different than the vibe coding tools, but these allow you to drag and drop different components into your app and build it that way. We actually built the first version of Posted on Flutterflow. We eventually transitioned to React Native, but the first version that we gave to customers and we gave to creators of Posted was built on a no-code tool. We used Flutterflow to validate the demands, get the MVP out there on a budget, and once we did validate that demand, we were able to switch code bases over to React Native. Step number three, and this is an absolute cheat code, is you can go over to CodeCanyon.net and you can buy preexisting app templates for as low as $20, $30, some $50. You can buy a pre-existing app template for pretty much any idea that you can think of. This is a fully developed app. They will give you the entire code base. You can start here, take that pre-existing template into a vibe coding tool, and you will have so much more success. It will be so much quicker for you because the code base already exists. So the last option, hiring a developer off Upwork. This is one of the most effective and high quality ways to get your app fully built. There are some very important things you need to know before hiring anyone on Upwork. This can be very dangerous, but also very powerful. And I hate to say it, there's a lot of people on Upwork who hide behind fake profiles, hide bad reviews, and this can lead to a lot of time wasted and money wasted. And I am speaking from experience here. When I was a young lad trying to hire developers off Upwork, I got burnt quite a lot. So let me share my Upwork strategy with you right now. Nowadays, I really only hire from one part of the world, and that is Eastern Europe. I've hired developers from all over the world: the United States, South America, Asia, None of them come close to the quality that I found in Eastern Europe. And not to mention, they're much more cost effective than any developer that you could hire in the United States. And something most development agencies in the United States don't want you to know, their agency, yes, is based in the United States, but more likely than not, these US agencies are outsourcing the work to Asia or different parts of the world. So always be careful if you're going to hire an agency and find out who's actually behind them and who's actually on their development team. Step number two in the Upwork hiring process: Once you create your job post and you throw it out there, again, you don't need to share the entire idea. You don't need to be concerned about people stealing your idea because you haven't shared your full idea yet. You just want to say generally what you need done and you want to post your job. And again, do not be scared of a developer stealing your idea because if you really want to, you can have them sign an NDA before you send them anything at all. But me personally, I've never had a problem of someone stealing my idea. And to be honest with you, the idea isn't the most valuable part. The execution of the idea is the most valuable part. Your idea is worth nothing. So don't be scared. of someone stealing your idea. And if you're really worried about it, you can have them sign an NDA just to get that out of the way. Okay, number two, I always look for developers who have a high amount of money earned and a high job success rate. The more money that these developers have earned on Upwork, and the higher their success rate, the higher chance they're a good developer. This might sound very obvious. But there are a lot of developers out there with a low amount of money earned, for example, like $1,000 or $0 earned on the platform. that will tell you some outrageous price, some super low price to get your app built. Speaking from experience, that's not what you want to go with. Next, once you successfully find a developer that you want to work with and you launch the contract on Upwork, there's something you need to know. Upwork is going to hold the money in escrow, and this is very, very important. The developer is never going to be able to touch that money until they deliver the product to you or if you set up milestones until they complete those milestones. This is so very important because it protects you against hiring the wrong person, you are can require that they give you something, they give you a piece of the product, a milestone or even the fully developed product before you release any of the cash. This way you can validate the quality of what they're building for you spend your entire budget with the wrong guy and you want to set your developer up for success. Give them detailed instructions, give them the Figma file, give them the brain dump where you have all of your ideas for what you want in the app and then create a structured timeline with milestones. If you can try to get the entire app built before you release any of the cash but a lot of developers don't like to do that So set up milestones that you can track and check the quality of. One other important key, you want to pay per amount of completed work. You do not want to pay hourly unless you're sitting right next to the developer making sure that they're logging their hours correctly. You want to pay per project or milestone completion. So ideally a fixed rate because let's be honest, hourly payments incentivize the developers to take more time building your product. But on the other hand, a fixed price payment structure will encourage the developer to get it done as fast as possible. so that they can get their payment. How much this is going to cost you entirely depends on the complexity of your app and if You've worked on it previously how much you got done with your app? The more complex your idea is - The more expensive it's going to be to hire a developer on Upwork. But if you only need a couple small tweaks to your vibe coded app, it could cost you a couple hundred bucks. Or if you want it built from scratch but your app is very simple, again the MVP, it can cost you anywhere from two to five grand. And hiring a developer and paying them a couple Gs on Upwork is a fraction of what traditional agencies will charge you. The timeline for hiring a developer and getting a product in your hands ideally should be anywhere from four to eight weeks. Sometimes 12 if you're pushing it. If it's any longer than that, Bad news for you. You're not building an MVP. You're building too much. Get it done quickly, go to market as fast as possible. Start getting feedback on your idea and start generating revenue. Step number five, one of the most important steps is setting up the tracking properly, setting up your payments, setting up your analytics, setting up your onboarding so that when you do launch your app, you're primed for success. You actually know what's going on in your product. Let's pretend for example, you launched an app with none of these done and you give it to 10,000 people and only 100 of them stick around and maybe 200 start the free trial. If you build your app, With none of this set up, you're going in blind. You have no idea what your users are doing inside your app. You have no idea if they're hitting the paywall, if they're converting on the paywall. You need to set up the proper analytics and revenue tracking inside your app. And here's how. For payments and subscriptions, don't worry. Apple handles everything. You can set up an App Store Connect developer account. And this is where you will upload your app and your previous screenshots. And this is also where you will build all the products or the in-app purchases that sit inside of your app. Apple will take a 15% fee from small developers, but... But don't worry, that's so worth it because they're going to send you organic traffic and they handle all the complexities behind the payments. If there's refunds, they handle everything for you. It is well worth the 15%. Trust me. For basic analytics and user authentication, you can use Google Firebase. This will allow people to sign in with Gmail, Facebook, Apple. This is Google's flagship app analytics platform. And it will tell you a lot of the stuff you need to know. Who your users are. How many downloads you're getting. How long they're sticking around. The retention rate. Some of the revenue metrics. Mainly, this is just your backend database and something that you use to allow users to sign in and create a profile on your app. The basic version of Firebase is completely free. They only start charging you when you start to scale past a certain number of downloads or tracked users. For subscription and revenue analytics, I like to use RevenueCat. RevenueCat will connect directly with your App Store Connects profile, track all your subscriptions, your lifetime value. your retention rate, your churn rate. It will give you a ton of useful analytics inside your app. And again, Revenue Cat is completely free until you hit a certain amount of tracked revenue. So there's no reason not to have it. Now, one of the most important tools and one of the biggest hacks and something you absolutely need if you want to be successful in your app is Superwall. Superwall is going to be how you control all of your paywalls. And Superwall is so amazing because you can AD test and remote update paywalls without launching a new version of your app. Previously, before Superwall, you had to build an entirely new version submitted to Apple, get it approved, before you could test a new paywall. When I implemented Superwall in my app, PuffCount, I tripled my revenue pretty much overnight. That's how powerful this tool is. And one cheat code is that you need to use a hard paywall. You need to use an unskippable paywall. And you might notice this: some apps you download and you can skip the paywall, but some you have to commit to a free trial or you have to even pay sometimes to get past the paywall and actually get into the real part of the app. This is very powerful because by forcing people to start a free trial or pay for your app, they're collecting the most amount of money at the most crucial time when they first download your app. And you might be concerned like why a hard paywall? Why not let people into my app? And again, this is something that you can A-B test with Superwall. But I'm telling you, if you switch to a hard paywall and you show it right after the onboarding, you will increase your conversion rate. And yes, less people will make it inside of your app and get to mess around actually with the real functionality of your app. But to be honest with you, we don't care about those users. we don't really care about the users who are not willing to pay for our product. Because at the end of the day, yes, we're building a cool app, but we need to make money to continue to grow this and turn it into a sustainable business. And a hard paywall is the best way to do that. Next, the user onboarding. This is one of the most important parts of your mobile app because in the onboarding, this is the user's first experience with your app. and it will prime them for the paywall. In the onboarding, you can use a tool like Amplitude or Mixpanel to track the drop-off rate between your onboarding screens. The onboarding is so important because you're adding positive friction before the hard paywall. You get to ask users why they're using your app. You get to nudge them with small questions about their problems that they're experiencing. And again, prime them for the paywall so they ultimately convert at a higher percentage. This makes them spend time in your app, dedicate more time to it so that you make them feel that sunk... cost bias. People are spending time, they're personalizing their profile, you're asking them questions about their problems so that by the time they hit the paywall, they're way more likely to pay because you've prodded and nudged them with strategic questions that make them think more about why they need your app. And the key insight here is that a really good onboarding will make the user feel like the app is built specifically for them and will get them to commit to converting on your hard paywall. Let's go into step number six, marketing and getting your first 100 users inside of your app. This is where organic content and your personal network become your best friend. And this is where so many people go wrong. They launch their app, they're still excited but they don't know how to market it. The most important part is distribution. And they try all these crazy things like paying creators an absurd amount of money or running paid ads with an absurd amount of money. Don't do that You can post content organically on the low and you can figure out what works before you decide to spend money in scale with creators or paid ads. And if you don't want to create the content yourself, you can go to postedapp.com And you can actually get content built at a very cost-effective rate from real creators. On Posted App, you can launch a deal, talk about your product, set some rules, set where you want the creators to be from, and creators will make content for your app for free. And you only pay for the content that you love. Posted App is an absolute cheat code when it comes to starting off your marketing with organic content and scaling it further in the future. And again, don't be scared to post content yourself as a founder. This is exactly what I did to get PuffCount off the ground. I committed to posting one TikTok every single day and I did that in my apartment. And that was how I scaled to my first 10,000 and even 50,000 users was with my organic content. And again, I created the content for free. I figured out what worked and then I was able to take those winning formats and spend effectively on creators and paid ads. And not all the videos are going to work for you, especially in the beginning. It can be a slow start, but do not get discouraged if you only get a couple hundred views because all it takes, again, is one video to change your business overnight. But you can speed up that path to success by doing market research on TikTok. Remember at the beginning how we talked about market research? You're going to pull in those same viral videos from your niche and you are going to recreate those and take inspiration from that content. By doing this, studying what's going viral in your niche already, you will be much more successful at creating content yourself or scaling it with other creators. For example, I saw this one format of this girl who dumped vapes into glasses of water and she got millions and millions and millions of views. So yeah, Guess what I did? I grabbed vapes, put them in water and then pitched my product at the end of the video. And that was one of my first viral concepts. And I use that over and over and over and over again. And it continued to work because once you find a one winning format on TikTok or any show from platform, you can use it over and over again to promote your product. And you can do this same approach for any niche. So go on TikTok or go on Instagram Reels, find content that is going viral in your space, study it and then create content. or then hire creators to create that content. You will be so much more successful, so much faster. And look, your early content doesn't need to be perfect. You can make super low effort videos as long as they're following the market research because your goal in the beginning is volume. Volume negates luck. By posting a lot of videos you are going to increase your chances that one of them pops off and once one of them does pop off, like my dropping vapes and water video, you can take it to the next level. For example: After I dropped the vapes in water, I knew that was a viral format. So I was like, "Hey, why don't we go into public and we'll have other people do this for us?" And we'll use a public interview format, which is very popular on TikTok but harder to get done. But we had already validated this idea so we knew it would work. So I hired a cameraman, we got a professional camera and a mic and everything. And then we took that content to the nth degree, but only because I'd validated it first. Next is app store optimization. This is something that you do not want to overlook. Because App Store organic traffic can be very powerful at getting you your first users and continuing to scale your app on autopilot in the future. So you want to make sure that you have keywords stuffed in your app's name, in the subtitle, and in your description. You can stuff all of these three places with keywords for your app and the problem it solves or the niche it's in. And probably the most important part of your App Store listing is your App Store preview screenshots. So put effort into these, make them professional, call out what the users are going to get the benefit of your app. in your apps or screenshots, and also some social proof if you can. Don't make them boring, don't just talk about your features, talk about what transformation the user is going to go through in your preview shots because those will convert like crazy. And also I'm gonna drop some crazy sauce here. One of the easiest ways to promote your app for free when you first launch it is to post on subreddits. This is a list of subreddits that you can post on about your products tailored to entrepreneurs. So you as an entrepreneur can talk about this product you've just launched and it's going to come off as organic, as natural, and people will even download your product and help support you. Reddit is a hidden gem for promoting products, but be sure that you're dropping value in these Reddit threads and not just promoting because if you're just promoting they'll probably ban you so be careful. And look the goal with your first couple hundred users is not really to make a ton of money yet obviously because we don't have enough volume coming in. The goal is to build momentum, understand what content is working in your app and also check your first version of your app for bugs and features and what are people loving and what are they hating? These first few users give you so much insight so that you can scale further in the near future. Now we are ready for the final step, step number seven, scaling your app to $10,000 per month and beyond with content and systems. And this is where you make the quantum leaps from 1,000 to $40,000 per month, like I did with PuffCount. One month I was doing 3K and the next month I was doing 20 and we kept growing after that until I eventually sold the business by using this scaling system and building systems so that I could do this consistently and profitably. Here's how you are going to take your best performing TikTok content and you're going to scale it. It sounds easy, but again, it takes volume. You're going to take your best performers and you're going to scale it in two ways. Number one, you're going to give it to other creators or influencers and you can tell them to make the exact same video and you can take those videos and put them on paid ads. Because if a piece of content goes viral organically, it's proven itself as a great high quality piece of content. And it is more likely to also convert on paid. So you can spend smarter on paid ads and not waste your budget. For example, I took my best performing Puff Count video and put it on paid ads. And from day one, it was profitable. From day one, it was profitable on paid ads because it had been validated organically. But look, you can't just set up your campaigns willy-nilly and hope for the best. You need to fill what is called the funnel. Because all these ad platforms, they don't know who you are. They don't know what your product is yet. So in your very first campaigns, you need to optimize for the top of your funnel, which is clicks and then you can optimize for installs and then eventually you can optimize for trial conversions. But it's very important that you start at the top because Facebook ads or meta ads, they need data about your ideal audience and your products in order to effectively find customers at the bottom of your funnel. And the crazy part is, this doesn't take very long because Tik Tok and meta ads are incredibly good. Their algorithms are incredibly good at finding your ideal customers. So as long as you give them a quality creative and you fill your funnel with enough data, they will find you customers at the lowest price possible. And the key thing to track here is your CAC to LTV ratio, your customer acquisition cost to your LTV, the lifetime value of your users. If you can acquire a customer for $10 and over their lifetime, they earn you 30, you have a three to one CAC to LTV ratio. This means... you have successfully built a money printing machine. Meaning, you can put $1 into paid ads and you know that you will get $3 out on the other side once the customer has gone through their life cycle. This is exactly how I scaled PuffCount. I had a profitable CAC to LTV ratio which allowed me to spend profitably on paid ads and I was able to travel the world and just spend money on paid ads and get a return on that spend. That is the key to scaling successfully. And eventually you might reach a point like I did. where I've been working on PuffCount for quite some time, and I had new ideas in other directions that I wanted to go with my life. And you might want to explore exiting your mobile app, which is the ultimate goal, I think, of any founder, is to exit their company and get this big liquidity event. And this is something that you can do at this stage, right? You're scaling, you built systems that scale, you're running paid ads so someone else can easily take over this business from you and they can run it without you needing to be there. And that's exactly what I did with PuffCount. And the beautiful thing about apps and SaaS and software in general is that you can get great multiples on your product. Because again, it's a turnkey business. I handed over PuffCount to another app development studio and they paid me a multiple of my annual recurring revenue. And again, I did this because I wanted to start a new business that was posted and I'm glad I did but you can always keep your app and you can scale it as long as you want for the rest of your life. It's up to you. And the beautiful thing about app businesses is they're very passive once they're set up successfully. Again, once I had PuffCount launched I had this library of content. All I had to do was check my paid ads dashboards once a day, make sure they were running profitably, and I was free to travel the world. Now let me prove to you that this system actually works by showing you my track record with people that I have worked with. With Puffcount, I started from absolutely zero. I'd never built an app in the health and wellness space before, and I successfully scaled it to 44k per month in monthly recurring revenue, before eventually selling the business to a larger mobile app studio in Europe. With Wordle, I built an app when I was a young lad and I got caught up in this viral craze. And with Posted, my latest app business, we have generated over $700,000 in sales in less than a year. But more importantly, the people that I work with in our app founders group are seeing incredible results using this exact same system. Like Simon who took his note-taking app to over $20,000 a month in monthly recurring revenue in under just five months. He had never built an app before and he used the exact same process that I just showed you. Or like Rick who has been a developer for a very long time and has scaled his portfolio to over $2 million in revenue. He builds simple utility apps using the validation and building strategies from this framework. And look, these aren't outliers. These are normal results when you follow a proven system instead of just trying to do everything yourself. And the reason this works is you're not just learning theory. You're getting a step-by-step blueprint that has been proven across many different apps and many different people. So this is not about luck or having some special talent. It's about following a process that removes all of the guesswork and helps you avoid the traps that 95% of app founders fall into. Now, what I just shared with you in this video is only a small piece of a bigger picture. Because unfortunately, I can't film a 25-hour masterclass about building a successful app here on YouTube. And I most definitely can't answer all of your questions that every founder has that only relates to To their own app and their own situation. But here's what I can do. I've built a private invite only community of app founders, just like you, people who are serious about building revenue generating apps and eventually exiting them for life changing capital. And it's called the app accelerator. And look, the app seller is not some course. It's a community driven system where I personally got a group of app founders through ideating, validating, building, scaling, and eventually exiting their mobile apps. even if they've never written a single line of code. And look, we all follow the same proven blueprint and we're all sharing tips, tricks, and growth hacks with each other inside of this community. And several of us are on the path to six, if not seven figure exits in the near future. So in the App Accelerator, you will be building alongside other ambitious founders, getting real feedback, accountability, and support. You won't be sitting through videos alone hoping you're doing everything right. So let me walk you through exactly what's inside this community and why joining it is the most effective way to launch and scale your mobile app. Inside the App Accelerator, everything revolves around our one shared goal: building apps that print cash and can eventually be sold at a multiple of their annual recurring revenue. You'll get access to all the core tracks and material that we follow and pair it with direct support from me with weekly group calls. So in the App Accelerator along other driven founders you will learn exactly how to validate, build, scale, and eventually exit a mobile app of your very own. There are so many small and specific questions that I can't possibly answer. And in general, you get to the video because every app is different. Every founder is different. Every journey is different. And that's exactly why I built this community and the weekly group calls with all these app founders, all sharing the same sauce at the same time with each other, all building and scaling their mobile apps. That's the real cheat code. The real cheat code is about surrounding yourself with people who have a similar goal and who have gotten where you want to be. And that's what this community is full of. It's full of seasoned app founders and app founders at every different stage of the process. We have people in the community who have come in who don't have an app idea, some who only have their app built and they've never marketed before. And we have some who are in the process of scaling to their first 10K months and beyond. We don't guess about things in this group. If you have a question, we have an answer. Every founder in the App Accelerator validates before building. They get their questions answered before building. That's how we move fast and avoid wasted effort together. The App Accelerator is broken into three main modules that will take you through the entire journey of idea to profit. And no matter what stage you're at, the App Accelerator will be valuable to you. Module 1 is Idea Validation and Research. In this module, you will master the art of market research and competitive analysis, and learn the 48-hour validation framework that ensures you will never build an app that nobody wants. You'll learn my niche selection criteria that guarantees demand, and We'll show you exactly how to analyze all the competitors in the market and learn from what they are doing well. You'll also get the legal setup guides for LLCs and your App Store account so that you're protected as your app scales. Module two is design and development. This is where I'll show you my AI design workflow that will allow you to launch a quality design at a fraction of the budget. And you'll learn how to optimize 99 designs contest to get the best, highest quality professional designs at a fraction of the cost. I'll show you how to use vibe coding and no code development tools to build a simple version of your MVP without knowing how to code. And you'll also get my complete Upwork development management system showing you how to post jobs effectively, hire the right talent, and retain that talent over a long period of time. Because as a founder, you want to build a company. You want to build a successful team. And of course, module three, which is launch and scale. This covers your app store submission and app store optimization to maximize your organic downloads. And of course, you'll learn my organic. content strategies that I use to get millions of views from my previous apps. I'll show you exactly how to scale with paid content creators and set up paid ad campaigns on TikTok and Meta, including how to set up your campaigns, how to target the correct audiences, and how to identify which ad creatives are actually going to work for you. You'll get analytics and KPI tracking setup guides so you know exactly how your app is performing. And finally, I'll show you exit strategy preparation so that you can build your app with acquisition in mind. down the line if you decide to sell. But look, the modules are just the beginning. The real value comes from the support and guidance that you get inside of the App Accelerator. You'll get one-on-one guidance directly from me including personal strategy sessions and direct feedback on your progress and troubleshooting when you're stuck. Now, the reason we have such a high success rate inside of the App Accelerator is because of our safety net system. I've noticed that people fail in building mobile apps not because they don't have the right information but because they fall through the cracks. They can start choosing the wrong niche or the wrong app idea or the wrong developer, or they choose the wrong marketing tactics, or they make content in the wrong way. So we've created three layers of safety nets to make sure this doesn't happen to you and to keep you motivated along the journey. Safety net number one is our private Slack community where all the founders are able to talk and discuss with each other, sharing all the tips, tricks, hacks, and roadblocks that you can avoid. In this community, you're going to find people starting at the exact same point as you. You just have an idea or you just launched your app or you're scaling past your first 10k month There are people in the community at the same stage you are and you'll get to share your journey together And this is the most important part. It is extremely important to have people alongside you especially when things get tough You want to surround yourself around people who have a shared vision a shared goal and more importantly it's around yourself with people who? Have already achieved that goal because a community stops it immediately from feeling like it's you against the world. These are people that can help you with your problems because they've walked the exact same path before. Safety net number two is our weekly group coaching calls. Every single week we have two group coaching calls. These two calls cover absolutely everything from technical questions about building your app and marketing strategies that help you scale your app, and everything else in between. I'm personally on these calls along with my team of experts who are in the community. And safety net number three is the one-on-one guidance you get directly from me. You'll get direct feedback on your progress and have access to troubleshooting calls if you get stuck. So again, this isn't some generic course. It's about getting personalized feedback and speaking to real people who are in the same situation that you are right now. Having these safety nets means you're never stuck wondering what to do next. You always have support, guidance, and a community of people who want to see you succeed. So the app accelerator advantage is that you get to skip the two-to-five-year learning curve that I went through personally as an app founder. Again, when I was young, there was no group like this. There was no blueprint to follow from other app founders who had done it before because it was all so new. And that's why I built this community. One place where driven app founders all share one common goal of succeeding together. And on top of that, you get all the exact tools, processes, guides, tips, tricks, and hacks that have all been proven to work across multiple apps. And you might be thinking to yourself, will this actually work for me? Is this right for me? Here's why I'm confident this will work for you. I've successfully built, scaled, and exited multiple apps using this exact framework. And my community members are getting the same results following the same system. So you're not learning theory here or guessing, you're following a proven battle-tested framework. And look, the alternative is figuring this out on your own for the next two years, tinkering, falling into the traps and the roadblocks that every founder has been through before. This speeds up your learning curve by asking people who have done it before, who've been in your shoes, who have hit the same roadblocks that you might hit on your journey. And no one wants to waste tens of thousands of dollars on bad developers, a bad idea, bad marketing, and potentially missing the app boom that we are going through right now. So listen, we're living in the golden age of building apps and software. AI tools are making design easier every month. No-code and vibe coding platforms are getting more and more powerful. And global talent is more accessible than ever before. But here's the thing: this window is not gonna stay open forever. As these tools become more and more accessible and more and more people find out about them, more people will start building apps, which means the space ultimately becomes more competitive than it already is. So the founders who take action today and learn these systems now will have a massive advantage over everyone else in the market. Every day you wait, other people are getting the results that you want. So if you want to build your own successful mobile app and you want the freedom that comes along with having your own successful mobile app and you want to skip the years of trial and error and get direct guidance from people who have been there and done it before, click the link below this video right now. Join the App Accelerator and join a group of driven founders who all have a shared goal of building, scaling, and eventually exiting their mobile apps. And if you have any questions that weren't answered in this video, we will answer them all in the link below this video right now. And finally, I want you to know that I'm here, I will continue to create content, and I want to see you succeed. Let's build something incredible together. I'll see you inside the App Accelerator.

Because you can work for yourself, Because you can work for yourself, you can have a lot of freedom in your life, you can have a lot of freedom in your life, you can work from anywhere, you can work from anywhere and it's never been easier than right now to build your own SaaS app, and it's never been easier than right now to build your own SaaS app, whatever. whatever. And in this video, And in this video, I'm going to give you a rundown of how to do it from idea to getting your app. I'm going to give you a rundown of how to do it from idea to getting your app done. in front of people and if you clicked on this video you clearly want to do it. in front of people and if you clicked on this video you clearly want to do it. So this is a complete playbook for you, So this is a complete playbook for you, it barely costs any money to start as well so no excuses let's get to it. it barely cost any money to start as well so no excuses let's get to it. We're going to go from how to come up with a good idea all the way through to real customers testing and using your product out there in the world. We're gonna go from how to come up with a good idea all the way through to real customers testing and using your product out there in the world. And this year I created a mobile app From Scratch which is about to be used by the UK government and over the last five years I have And this year I created a mobile app from scratch which is about to be used by the UK government And over the last five years, I have built a lot of different apps. built a lot of different apps. So I've built finance, So I've built finance, AI, AI, SaaS and now it's time to brunch out and make my own after building apps for other people. SaaS. And now it's time to brunch out and make my own after building apps for other people. And I taught myself to code at 30 so I know what it's like to feel overwhelmed by the technical side of making an app. And I taught myself to code at 30. So I know what it's like to feel overwhelmed by the technical side of making an app. But if you take it step by step and follow this playbook I'm going to give you, But if you take it step by step and follow this playbook I'm going to give you, you will get there. you will get there. You just got to become a problem solver basically. You just got to become a problem solver basically and I'll teach you how. And I'll teach you how. But if there's one thing I've learned is that building it is just the first step. But if there's one thing I've learned is that building it is just the first step. Things have changed now, Things have changed now. it's a lot easier to build so a lot of your focus should be on distribution i.e how to get eyeballs on your product and before I worked in tech I actually worked in marketing for a few years so learn all about this and it's still crazy to say this but I built up a social media following of about half a million people and this is one of the best things you can do to get distribution for your product. It's a lot easier to build so a lot of your focus should be on distribution, i.e. how to get eyeballs on your product. And before I worked in tech, I actually worked in marketing for a few years. So learn all about this and it's still crazy to say this, but I built up a social media following of about half a million people. And this is one of the best things you can do to get distribution for your product. I'm going to make another video on that. I'm going to make another video on that so subscribe if you want to see it. So subscribe if you want to see it. So the reason I'm saying this is that along the way So the reason I'm saying this is that along the way I've learned how to build an app from scratch, I've to build an app from scratch, but also how to market it. but also how to market it. To get in the hands of real users, to get in the hands of real users, not just your weird uncle or grandmother. not just your weird uncle or your grandmother. So the whole goal of my page is to teach you guys these skills. So the whole goal of my page is to teach you guys these skills. All I ask is that if you do get value, All I ask is that if you do get value, just like the video, just like the video. it's free for you, It's free for you and it would help me out massively. and help me out massively. And I'm gonna be building myself. And I'm going to be building myself so let's go on this journey together, So let's go on this journey together, travel the world doing it, travel the world doing it, have fun, have fun and build cool stuff. and build cool stuff. And it doesn't have to be a million dollar app. And it doesn't have to be a million dollar app. You can literally just copy something that's already on the market and it could pay your rent. You can literally just copy something that's already on the market and it could pay your rent. Okay, Okay we're two minutes in, we're two minutes in. Let's get to the first technical question. let's get to the first technical question. Do you need to learn to code? Do you need to learn to code? Different people on YouTube will tell you different things. Different people on YouTube will tell you different things. This is my take. This is my take. I think you should, I think you should, but the definition of "learn to code" but the definition of learn to code has changed a lot with AI. has changed a lot with AI. It's basically a lot easier nowadays. It's basically a lot easier nowadays. Also, Also, you don't need to go as deep as a software engineer, you don't need to go as deep as a software engineer, which is what I am, which is what I am, would do. would do. i.e. I.e. You don't have to know data structures and algorithms, you don't have to know data structures and algorithms, which is what I teach on this channel. which is what I teach on this channel. Now if you enjoy it, Now if you enjoy it, go deeper, go deeper, alright? alright? But if you just want to build an app But if you just want to build an app Just learn the fundamentals. Just learn the fundamentals. Then you learn as you go. Then you learn as you go. So this is called project-based learning. This is called project-based learning. It is the best way to learn where you are presented with problems, It is the best way to learn where you are presented with problems, real world problems for your app, real world problems for your app and you learn coding by solving these problems. and you learn coding by solving these problems. And the reason I recommend it is that knowing some fundamentals, The reason I recommend it is that knowing some fundamentals, you can speak the language of code to an AI coding assistant. you can speak the language of code to an AI coding assistant. For example, For example, with frontend, with front end, it's just really helpful to know some HTML, it's just really helpful to know some HTML, CSS when you get in these horrendous errors that you're definitely going to get. CSS when you get in these horrendous errors that you're definitely going to get. And also if you are serious about this then learning how to code I'd say is a good idea. And also, if you are serious about this, then learning how to code, I'd say, is a good idea. In a perfect world, In a perfect world You'll learn clean code, you'll learn clean code, but this is not a perfect world. but this is not perfect world You want to build an app so learn what you need to and learn by doing but let's rewind Let's go to step one the idea or a good way to look at it is a problem You're trying to solve now If you've got literally no idea here a good thing to do is focus on real world problems that you have So maybe write down a list of You want to build an app, so learn what you need to and learn by doing. But let's rewind and let's go to step one, the idea. Or a good way to look at it is a problem you're trying to solve. Now, if you've got literally no idea here, a good thing to do is focus on real-world problems that you have. So maybe write down a list of 5 to 10 problems in your life that can be solved by technology. 5 to 10 problems in your life that can be solved by technology. Because if you're having this issue, Because if you're having this issue, I bet you other people are and they're willing to pay for a service that solves that problem. I bet you other people are and they're willing to pay for a service that solves that problem. Or if you can't find any problems in your own life, Or if you can't find any problems in your own life just copy a product or a service that's already on the market and there is already a demand for. just copy a product or a service that's already on the market and there is already a demand for. So don't feel guilty about having to come up with your own idea. So don't feel guilty about having to come up with your own idea. A great example of this is Amazon. A great example of this is Amazon. Amazon aren't massively innovative but they copy other products but they do it so well that they become the market leader in that area. Amazon aren't massively innovative but they copy other products but they do it so well that they become the market leader in that area. This is great if you're starting totally from scratch. This is great if you're starting totally from scratch. So don't feel bad about copying, So don't feel bad about copying. maybe give it different marketing, Maybe give it different marketing, give it your own personality and just add different features to give your own twist to it. give it your own personality and just add different features to give your own twist to it. So yeah, So yeah, don't feel you have to be so creative. don't feel you have to be so creative. If there is a product out there, If there is a product out there, clearly there is a demand for that product. clearly there is a demand for that product. So take advantage of it. So take advantage of it. Now at this stage there is a hack and I've worked with some indie developers who do this because you think at this point you'd be like "Okay, Now at this stage, there is a hack and I've worked with some indie developers who do this because you think at this point you'd be like "Okay, I need to build the app, I need to build the app right?" right?" Not necessarily. Not necessarily. What some people do is they build a landing page What some people do is they build a landing page They market the product, They market the product, they see if there's a demand, they see if there's a demand, they've not even built it yet and if there is a demand they'll build it or they might even pitch it to investors. they've not even built it yet. And if there is a demand, they'll build it or they might even pitch it to investors. So you can try that if you want. So you can try that if you want. All right let's fast forward and pretend that you have an idea at this stage. All right, let's fast forward and pretend that you have an idea at this stage. Now the question a lot of people ask at this stage is what tech stack should you use? Now the question a lot of people ask at this stage is what tech stack should you use? This is not as important This is not as important. As you think, as you think, but the most important thing is I said earlier to do project based learning. but the most important thing as I said earlier is to do project-based learning. So learning by doing projects or with us, So learning by doing projects or with us, we're building this app. we're building this app so we're learning that way. So we're learning that way. The reason I'm suggesting this is because a lot of people end up in tutorial hell where you just watch other people code and you don't actually learn anything, The reason I'm suggesting this is because a lot of people end up in tutorial hell where you just watch other people code and you don't actually learn anything, but you feel like you're learning. but you feel like you're learning. The tech stack is dependent on what you want to build, The tech stack is dependent on what you want to build right? right? And a quick Google search will help you. And a quick Google search will help you, But always pick the most popular tech stack you can. but always pick the most popular tech stack you can. Why? Why? Because these AI coding assistants have been trained on years and years of code. Because these AI coding assistants have been trained on years and years of code. So these coding assistants will perform better on popular languages. So these coding assistants will perform better on popular languages and also there's just so much more documentation online if you come into an error, And also, there's just so much more documentation online.

## Transcription

Okay, so I challenged myself to build an app that reaches $2000 of monthly profits starting from scratch as a student. I thought 30 days max. Well, that's what I thought because a lot can go wrong. Apple rejections: content strategies that completely flop and eating zero dollars thinking it's over. And you'll see it ends up a lot closer to 60 days. Through this challenge, I'm going to test different ideas, different strategies, but most importantly, I'm gonna prove to you that even as a CS student doing a remote internship, you can build something that actually makes money. But before we start who I am and why should you care? I'm Arthur, I'm 20, fourth year of computer science. Last year, I co-founded an AI startup for doctors. We raised money, built for month, but long story short, that was a complete failure. We never talked to users in your market fit and build features nobody wanted. But that failure taught me more than all my classes combined. So that's why I started this YouTube channel: to prove that you don't need the perfect ID, you don't need funding and you don't even need to know everything. Stop waiting and start building In this video, I'm showing everything, no filter. How I found the ID, built it, failed it and iterated until people actually started paying money. No fake timeline, no VC money and no going viral, just a regular student with $200 of ad budget testing until something works. If you're watching this, it means something worked. Let's build I need to find an app idea, but I'm not trying to invent something revolutionary. I want something that's already proven to work just with a different angle or target market. The goal is to build as fast as possible an MVP, minimum viable product. Basically the simplest version of the app to test if people will actually pay for this. So I go straight to the App Store. I'm scrolling through the top-grossing apps and I notice that Affirmation apps are everywhere. These are literally apps that just show you motivational quotes. One feature, that's it. Perfect for what I want. It's super simple to build, quick to test, no complex feature. I don't know the top three: I am, daily affirmations and daily motivation. They are literally identical. Same quote, same design, same everything. Now here's where it gets interesting. I'll actually be on exchange next semester in those countries and Nordic countries are known to have brutal winters. We are talking about four hours of sunlight per day and huge seasonal depressions. That's my opportunity. Same app concept but actually designed for people going through dark winters. Warm UI, cozy feeling and quotes that acknowledge their reality. So here's my process. I screenshot everything from the IAM app to understand the patterns. Every screen, every flow and holy the onboarding is painful. More than 40 questions. But right after this marathon onboarding they hit you with a three-day free trial pop-up. Just like Duolingo, pay now or start the trial. It's quite smart but aggressive. The app is actually dead simple. Swipe to see and like quotes. Literally TikTok but for affirmations. Then I open Figma. That's where you design apps before coding. I'm dumping all these screenshots in but I'm not keeping all this. The onboarding is way too long for me. I'm keeping maybe 15 screens max. Tomorrow we will actually start designing our app. Yesterday, I mapped out what features I need. Today it's all about design. I want to make this app feel cozy and warm, not a robot sending you those codes. Now you might think I'm wasting time not starting coding right now, but I want to plan everything to know the button size, the screens, the shapes and the colors. My code flows way faster when I know exactly what I want to do. The first thing for inspiration is this website called Dribbble. It's basically Pinterest but for designers. I want to find UI elements I really love and that could match the cozy and warm mood we're going for. So to create my brand and app identity, I need to create a mascot. I'm following this tutorial from Chris Rarock who's a solo app developer who's making those cute little mascots for his apps. And he's recently made a video explaining his whole process creating those mascots with GPT, so I just followed it. ChatGPT suggested me a candle character and I think that's perfect. A little candle that keeps glowing even when everything's dark. That's literally the whole concept of the app. I'm calling him Glow, our little candle friend. Now for the actual UI components. I'm using cloud to help me generate IDs for the color palette, input and button styles. It's not perfect at all but that's also a good base. I'm not a designer so with this I can have a pretty good base to start the coding part. Let the coding begins We'll start by creating the basic structure. For that, I'm opening the terminal and I create a new expo project. All right, I've just set up a new expo project. So here is the blank project. I set up the server so it's running on the simulator. So I'm just following the the basic get started. It's really well made and quite easy to follow you just have to run a few commands and you have your basic app running there. Now the base is created, we need to add all the other features. We won't have any login or sign up on the app because we will store everything on device. That's way easier for us. The only thing that we have to set up right now is notifications, but we won't use a complex system with server backend and so on. The app will work by itself. So even on airplane mode it will work. I'm using Cloud Code to quickly test the notifications just to be sure that it works as expected. So you can send test notifications. You also have them on the notification center just there. And then if you click on them, app it opens the app. Now the fun part: that first onboarding screen. This is so important This is where users decide if they trust your app or delete it. One chance to make them feel welcome. I'm translating my Figma design into React Native code then positioning Glow, our candle mascot right in the center. The mascot animation is key. I want him to do this little bounce when the screen loads like he's excited to meet you. After an hour of tweaking, the first screen is perfect. It feels warm, it feels welcoming, it doesn't feel like every other app. Glow is coming to life. Today's mission is to build the entire onboarding flow and somehow figure out the widgets. Apparently you need to code in native language for widgets so it will be Swift for iOS. I'll only start with iOS for now but I've never used Swift in my whole life so that's gonna be interesting. First, I need to create an animation for when users allow notifications. You know sometimes you hesitate so that's why I want to create an animation to make this whole process about notifications a bit less invasive. I'm using Jitter for this. Think of it as Canva but for animations. They have templates for everything: loading animations, success dates, whatever. I'm taking their notification template and customizing it. Now for the next 3 hours, I coded all the onboarding screens. And honestly, it's just copy pasting components and changing text. Super repetitive. So I'm speed running through this part because I'm just typing the same React Native components over and over. I'm done with the onboarding. I just wanted to quickly show you what it looks like. So this screen was the screen we made yesterday with the animation. Then I ask your name. So whatever. I ask for your age. It will be very useful for analytics. Then how do you identify? So female, male or prefer not to say. Then how do you improve your mental health? That's also for analytics. If I want to add some categories and so on. A screen about the benefits of daily affirmations because you don't necessarily know why and what it is for. The notifications part, so here's the animation we made this morning. I'll just show you again. You can choose how many notifications you want per day and the time, the start and end time. I wanted to create a daily habit thing, a bit like Duolingo, so you have to check the app every day. For retention-based app, it's amazing. Then you can choose the categories. So what type of codes do you want? Then the widgets. It's on your face screen for now because I don't even know how to code widgets. And then the special offer screen exactly like the iam app because if you want to pay now, you can. So that's it for the onboarding. There are lots of screens but actually it's really fast to complete everything. The onboarding is finally done. Now it's time for the unknown: the widgets. So here's the thing about widgets: Expo can do them. So that's going to be pretty fun because I have to write native code and I'm so bad at Swift. But I'm following this tutorial from a guy who explains how to implement those widgets, which is exactly what I need. The concept is actually really simple. A widget is just a tiny app that lives on your home screen. It can do much, just display information and have a few interactions like simple buttons. So for me, that's perfect because I just want to display basic code, so only text. That's probably going to be pretty easy to do. Guys, just look at that. Two widgets. So the first one is the small squared one and a full width one. I've also added the mascot at the bottom left, and it looks like he's looking at the quote. I think it looks really nice. And when you click on it, it just opened the app. So that's really basic. Actually, the widget will fetch a random quote every hour and show it so it will change throughout the day. Today was actually a good day. We implemented so much. We made all the onboarding screens. and the two widgets. Tomorrow's gonna be interesting, I'll try to implement in-app subscriptions with Revenue Cat. And I think I have to buy a new Apple Developer account because my current one is linked to my startup and I want to differentiate them. Today is the expensive day, that's time to actually set up payments because a business without revenue is just an expensive hobby. And I'll start by buying a new Apple Developer account So that should be good. We are just waiting the processing time, it should be a few hours. But we can start the Revenue Cat part right now because that's gonna be a bit long. Let me quickly explain how app monetization works because nobody breaks this down. When someone pays on your app, Apple and Google just take a 30% cut which is huge. But Apple made a small business program which just reduces the 30% cuts to 15%. So you have 85% of the global price left to you. That's where Revenue Cat comes in. They handle all the painful stuff. Recipe validation, subscription status, the whole mess. And it's free if you make a under $2,500 per month, which is perfect for starting out. Setting up Revenue Cat with Apple is a mess. I need to create something called an API key, which is basically a password that lets Revenue Cat talk to Apple. I'm going through Apple's dashboard and I download my key, then I upload it to Revenue Cat. Next, I name my project and add the bundle ID, which is the unique code that identifies it. But before creating it, Apple wants to know everything. Will you use the camera, the localization, and so on? Finally creating the app in App Store Connect with the bundle ID. Then I copy it to Revenue Cat. One more key to upload, the purchase key which is another password specifically for payments. After 30 minutes of back and forth between dashboards, Revenue Cat is finally connected. Now the fun part: creating the actual subscriptions I'm making two options: monthly for $10 and yearly for 40 with a 3 days free trial. That's a huge difference but I want people committing long term. The pricing gets tricky though because I need different prices for Nordic countries. Each country needs its own price point because currencies are different. Now building the actual paywall in the app. What's brilliant about Revenue Cat is they have paywall templates. I chose this clean one with three sections: Hero image at the top where Glow, our mascot will go, testimonials in the middle and pricing cards at the bottom. Once it looks perfect, one click to publish. Now comes the slightly technical part: adding these to my app code. Installing the revenue cat library, adding my API credentials and creating a custom build. I've integrated the payroll on the app so you have the yearly and monthly plan. The yearly has a three days free trial because I think that's way better for conversion. So it's in test mode but you can directly pay there. So that's it for the in-app payments. Now I want to quickly create a super base database because it's getting quite late. I want to store all the data linked to the onboarding and the in-app feedback because I want to have some analytics that will guide me through the iterations. I'm keeping this dead simple: two tables, one for users with onboarding answers and another one for feedbacks like feature requests. So when user finishes onboarding, I just send their choices to Superbase. Tomorrow's mission is finishing all the app content. We're so close to having something real. Today was a marathon, literally eight hours straight of coding to finish every single screen in the app. From the home screen with categories to the settings, the streak tracker and the favorite section. Everything That's the day: the app reveal. So I'll show you exactly what I've added today, everything that I've coded. So first thing first: the swipe feature. You can swipe up and down like TikTok. You can also like the coat by clicking on the heart or double-clicking on the coat. I've also made a cool animation with the mascot at the bottom left so if you click on him he'll do a little jump and wear glasses. So he looks like he's reading the code with you. And if you click again on him, he'll just disappear at the bottom left. I've also added categories. So if you click at the bottom right, you can choose between all the categories. So let's choose the favorites, for instance. I've also added the mix. So if you want to select multiple categories, you can. You just click there and select them and it will create your own mix. And the last thing is all the settings things. So you can see your streak. and modify your name, your gender, and also make a feedback. So if you want to send features request or whatever, that's here. Today was actually an amazing day because I finished the app. I mean, I'm not done yet because I have to submit it to the App Store and maybe they'll reject it. So tomorrow I'll create the different policies and the landing page to submit everything to the App Store. and the process will be between 24 and 48 hours for the review to happen. So fingers crossed for tomorrow, I won't publish that app so bad and if it works first try, that would be amazing. I've created a new Next.js project and honestly, Claude wrote 90% of it. I tweaked the styling and tried to add the exact same look as the app. The whole process is blazing fast when you're not trying to be fancy and I've also made some assets in Figma. Just iPhone mockups with our app screens inside, that's not perfect but it looks professional enough. The landing page is done in one hour. It's very basic, it's purely UI. So you have a little description on the left and a screenshot on the right. I've also made three cards explaining the different features. So the widget, the notification and the categories. That's really basic. I've added two policies. So the privacy policy and the terms of use. Those are mandatory if you want to publish your app because Apple requires them. I've written everything with ChatGPT and it's okay for now because it's the beginning. I've described in details how the app works, but if the app grows, I'll rewrite them with a lawyer. Now the submission part. With Expo it's stupidly simple: EAS build to create the package and EAS submit to send it to Apple. EAS handles all the complicated sign-in certificates and provisioning profiles that used to make developers cry. I'm heading to the airport right now because I have a flight to Bangkok to see my girlfriend. She's there on her exchange semester so I'll spend one month with her. I'll submit the app from the airport so the timing is actually perfect. Apple usually takes 24 to 48 hours to review the app and my flight is in 6 hours. So while I'm in the air, Apple will be reviewing Glow. Wait I forgot the App Store assets. The real pain: screenshots for all the different iPhone sizes. I'm at the airport right now trying to design these in Figma. I used a template with a clean background, screenshots of the app and some explanation text. Nothing fancy but it needs to be done before I can submit. I'm submitting from my gate and when I land, we'll know if we are approved or rejected. Guess who's back? I just landed in Bangkok. I'm in the Chatuchak district right now, which is right in the heart of the city. Check out this view from here, that's beautiful and that will be my new office for the next few weeks. Now the sad part, Apple rejected Glow. That's not a big deal because the issue is so stupid. So in App Store Connect there is this section called privacy where you have to list everything your app collects, name, email, that kind of stuff. But there is a checkbox for each data type asking you if you're using it for tracking purposes, which in Apple language means advertising or reselling these data to third parties. And my dumb ass checked yes on everything without even reading. So Apple thinks I'm building the next Facebook stealing all your data, when really I just store your name to say "Hey Sarah" on the app. The reviewer was actually really nice about it, he just told me there was a mismatch between my privacy policy and what I entered in App Store Connect. And in my case it's pretty simple to fix it, I just have to modify the App Store Connect part So no code to change. The fix takes 5 minutes, unchecking all the tracking boxes and making sure it's now reflecting properly what I'm actually doing with this data. Also adding a comment explaining exactly what changed so the next reviewer doesn't have to dig through everything. And this is actually super common. Most apps get rejected on first submission for tiny things like this: privacy policy mismatch like in my case or forgot to test on iPad or whatever. It's actually Apple's way of keeping quality high. So I'm resubmitting the app right now. See you in 48 hours when hopefully we're actually live. It's been five days, five whole days. I don't know why it took so long but Apple finally reviewed and accepted the app so we're finally live. But right now nobody knows we exist and it's time to change that. First, App Store Optimization or ASO which is basically SEO but for apps. If you don't optimize for the right keywords there is too much competition so you're invisible. For this I'm using this tool called Astro and I'm smiling because that's a pure banger. This tool is exactly what you need to find and spot the right keywords. It will show you for every keyword the competition by country. The strategy is really basic, you need to find popularity above 20 and difficulty under 50. So you can check the keywords used by other apps to have some ideas or just try by hand like asking ChatGPT what would be right keywords for my app and describing your app. And you also have some suggestions here "Health" which means health in Norwegian. The popularity is nearly at 70 and the difficulty is under 50 at 46. So that might be a keyword that I want to keep. Now for the launch strategy, I need users, I need feedbacks and create some initial traction. So I want to try something making the app completely free with a lifetime access of the pro version. No payment, no subscription, just download the app and keep it forever. I won't make any money from this but that's not the point. I really want to have some downloads and some App Store feedbacks to start that initial traction. The next part is leveraging my YouTube community, so that's you guys. I already make tech content on this channel and you guys are literally my first users. So I'm creating YouTube Shorts documenting the whole process exactly like this video but in short formats. I quickly wrote the script in Ocean then recorded my voice and then edited the video in Premiere Pro. I created two different shorts. I post one every 2 days and hopefully we'll get some downloads. So the first few days are crucial. If we can get to 100 downloads and some feedbacks, the App Store will do its algorithm thing and start to show us to more people. I'll probably be back in a few days when we'll get some interesting news. The rhythm's been slower lately, less filming and more analyzing. I wanted to gather some real data before adjusting the strategy. So let me show you where we're at. Current downloads nearly 900 so let's break down the traffic sources. We can see that AppRefer made the most downloads. What is AppRefer? It's simply when an app like Instagram just sent a user to my App Store page and then they download the app. We can see the details by clicking there. WeChat made nearly 200 downloads. WeChat is a chat app used in Asia. A lot of Chinese people use WeChat to chat, and actually I had lots of Chinese downloads so I think someone shared the app on a group or whatever and it drove lots of traffic. Then AppRaven with AppGuns free. It was an old method to promote your app, but I didn't do anything, but I still had traffic. I just checked and I have a page there that's automatically created that drove some traffic and then Telegram and some other apps. I also made one single Reddit post because the other ones got banned. On the productivity app subreddit, I just explained, hey, the app is free for now. Do you want to test it? And I got 10 upvotes and nearly 3000 views. Now YouTube, I make two shorts that got 20,000 views in total. And I put a special link there to really track how many users clicked on the link. Here is the tracking. We got nearly 300 clicks, which is really good. But then when we check in App Store, the web refers, we can see that tap it. So the tool that I use just made 10 downloads. That's actually a really bad conversion for 20,000 views to have only 10 downloads. But that was pretty normal because my audience on YouTube are only developers, so they don't really look for affirmation apps. The last thing is Revenue Cat. If we check non-subscription, that's more than 600 people just claimed their free trial. It doesn't mean that we will have lots of subscriptions after that. It was free, so obviously lots of people claimed it. But I wanted to share it with you. I also got some reviews because at the beginning, the goal of that lifetime free access was to have some traffic and some reviews on the app store. I got eight ratings with two one star review, which makes an average of four out of five. That's actually pretty bad to one star reviews, but whatever. And one of those one star reviews was someone complaining that they couldn't buy premium obviously because the app was free. I don't know why I deserve a one star review for that. Keep in mind that you have to answer those comments. You're not answering to that angry guy. You are actually showing all the future users that you give a shit. I made a straightforward answer explaining, oh sorry for the confusion, it was actually an offer and here's how you can claim your free trial. And maybe when you're really nice in the comments they could change the review but I don't really think so. The app store keywords need work though because I'm getting downloads but retention sucks. Only 15% of users came back day two so people downloaded but expected something else. So I'm tweaking less generic keywords and more specifically. The title now has two to three main keywords and subtitle as supporting ones. This tells Apple exactly who to show the app to. I'm doing this before driving new traffic because I really want good stats on those new specific keywords. Apple ranking system is actually a black box, but we know that they rank apps based on the most recent reviews. So new reviews on new keywords equals higher ranking. From now on, I'm only coding updates based on actual data. I noticed that only two thirds of users actually allow notifications, which kills the whole concept of daily codes. I'm adding a new screen before the permission pop up explaining that notifications are a core feature of the app. And if they still say no, there is another screen after that that will explain them that they're really missing something from the app. And I will obviously measure if this improves the rate. As I said, I'm only coding two things from now: stuff from user feedbacks and improvements to key metrics. My key metrics are simply retention, conversion, and user demographics. The most important one is retention by far because if users log in daily on the app, I won't have any problem to convert them. Now that we know the app works and traffic sources are identified, it's time for the real game: organic content creation. Today is day 18 and that's time to go all in in organic content. For TikTok, I just spent the last few days just warming up the account. It means liking, commenting and interacting with the type of post you want to target. But I didn't post anything because I want the TikTok algorithm to flag me in that niche so when I'll start to post it will know exactly who to show my content to. The key is testing different hooks so only change the beginning of the video just to see which one grabs the most attention and then all in on that kind of video. And the strategy is really simple, we'll post only three formats. The first type is POV videos like "POV you finally found a wellness app for seasonal depression". That kind of video is really easy to make and works pretty well if you can identify your users problems. The second type is product demos like "here's my morning routine with Glow". Here you just want to show your app's features. For me it will be widgets on the home screen, opening the app and swiping through codes. People love seeing apps in action. The third and last one is results or transformation. Like I use this app for three weeks, here's what's changed. It's before and after vibes but targeted for your niche. The plan for the next few days is actually pretty simple but really exhausting. Just create 10 to 20 pieces of content and post 2 to 3 per day. I just want to see what hits and then just iterate and create more content of that kind. It's a numbers game, most will flop for sure but we only need one to pop off. I'm also setting up a link tree that's the link in BioTool everyone uses. One link that leads to the app store also shows everything. Plus it tracks clicks so I know exactly where the traffic comes from. Quick Reddit update: I'm still posting every day on one or two subreddits, and yesterday I posted on the Expo subreddit and the team actually reached out. They want me to write a blog post about the whole process and that's freaking sick As an Expo developer, to be able to write a blog post on their own website feels amazing. I'm also getting emails and DMs from users about what they like, what features they like to see added, and how they're using the app. This engagement is so valuable for truly understanding how to help them the most. This is the grand phase: no more coding unless something's broken. Just creating content, content, and more content. The app works and people like it when they find it, now we need to be sure that they will find it. It's day 22 and I've posted about 15 videos on my TikTok account Only two broke the 2,000 views and that converted to exactly two trial signups and they both cancelled immediately. I'll keep posting because you never know what might randomly blow up but it's time to prepare plan B, paid ads. Right now when someone downloads the app from TikTok, I have no idea where it came from. But TikTok needs to know okay this guy came from this ad or this one to really optimize the ad. So I'm installing the TikTok events SDK, adding tracking codes and making sure it fires when someone installs the app, opens the app and starts a trial. While updating the code, I'm adding the most requested feature: dark mode. I got at least 20 messages asking for it and Glow looks even cuter on dark backgrounds. That part took ages like literally 6 or 7 hours of coding because it was so hard. Let me show you what happened. When you create a campaign in the TikTok Ads Manager, you can select App Promotion and App Install. So TikTok will optimize the campaign to gather the most app installs per dollar spent. You have three choices. The first one is to connect to a mobile measurement partner, which is super expensive, like a few cents per app install, which is way too expensive for me. Or you can select I don't use a mobile measurement partner service, but this won't really work because TikTok won't have enough data or or just data at all to optimize the campaign. The last choice is to use TikTok events SDK, which is not supported by React Native or Expo. So I had to build my own library with native code on top of a broken library. It was super exhausting, but it finally works. I'm submitting the new app version to Apple. The update includes TikTok attribution tracking, dark mode and a clearer onboarding. So everything should be set up. I'll keep posting on TikTok while waiting for our Apple team to review the app. And in the next few days, I'll show you exactly how to set up a TikTok ad campaign. Everything from the video to the different settings. It's day 23 and the app is already accepted by Apple. It went so quick. We will now create the campaign on the TikTok ads manager. The first thing is to explain to TikTok why do you want to spend money on ads? Is it to get views, to get interactions, to get sales? For us, it's app install. So we will switch to the full version. Confirm. And there we can see app promotion and we'll select smart campaign. TikTok will target by itself the best audience. We won't have to set up anything. Then iOS 14 dedicated campaign. We want to only target iOS users because our app is only on iOS app. And let's select the app we created yesterday. So by default, the goal will be click, but we don't want click. We want install then the budget. So how much money do you want to spend per day? At the beginning of this challenge, I told that we will use in total $200 from my money. Daily spend should be at least $50 per day. Here it's in euros so a bit less like 45 euros per day. But because we have so low budget, I'll only use something like 25 to 30 euros. Then the schedule: we won't touch anything because this campaign is a test campaign. It will run for three days to see which creative is the best and then we will put all the remaining money on the last creative. Then there is the audience targeting, so which country do you want to target? In my case it will be Nordic countries, so I'll add three or four of them. Then there is the minimum age. I won't touch this but you can select 18 or 25 years old. I would say that 25 years old should be better but I'm not really sure so I will leave 18. We won't touch anything on placement and then the best part Add generation. That's here that we can add our creatives. I will simply just add video or image and use TikTok posts so the posts that I've made are now listed here and I can select like two of them for instance. Through those creatives, I try to target different parts of the app so one will showcase for instance the widget, one will showcase the notifications and so on. I just forgot to mention one parameter which is languages. Just select your app language so that users you're targeting will speak the language of your app. For me it will be just English. I'm quickly editing three new TikToks to have more samples for the campaign. Then back to the TikTok dashboard to import the post I just made. I'm testing six different videos in this campaign and finally we can click on publish. Hopefully we will make some conversion because with $100 of ads we will get lots of traffic, so fingers crossed And I'll keep you updated if anything happens. Day 24, my ads got approved and ran for one day. But from the logs I'm not sure I'm perfectly sending the TikTok payload for the attribution part. So I'm pausing the TikTok campaign and making a quick update to batch it. Exactly like last time when I implemented that mode, this time I also implement a new feature and this will be themes. So I change a bit the UI on the top left you now have a premium button if you click on it and you're not subscribed the payroll will go down. I also changed the bid to paywall just to show what features you unlock when you pay. The new feature is on the bottom right. It's only a premium feature and you can select a new background for your affirmations. Lots of users ask for it because the other affirmations apps are doing the same, so I just implemented it. And when approved by Apple, I'll just resume the TikTok campaign for the last two days. Today is day 26, I guess. And I have two good news, two really good news. First, I was scrolling on Reddit and I found this post about Apple ads. On the App Store you can pay Apple to make an ad and have better ranking on some keywords. I read the post and I saw in a comments that Apple gave $100 credits so I immediately created an account on Apple ads and a few minutes later I received this email. We've applied your $100 promo credit to your account. I've added a few trending keywords to hopefully rank on them, but it's free credit so we'll see what happens. The second good news is on TikTok ads. I've created a new account for this challenge and I saw this thing get up to 6,000 USD as credit for new accounts. The offer is pretty simple: if you spend $200 they'll give you $200 in ad credits. So in total with Apple, we will have $300 of credits by only spending $200, which is amazing. That's $500 in total. Really good news for today. It's day 31. I'm finally back in France and today I wanted to show you the TikTok ads results because I have all the data. As you'll see, results are really bad but you have to keep running your ads for at least three days because TikTok algorithm works really well but you have to give him time. If you cut it too early, It won't have time to really target the right audience and show your ad to the right people. Here are the results. You can post the video if you want to check in details, but what matters is the budget. So I spent 30 euros every day. I got nearly 100 downloads per day. I have a trial to paid ratio really low, even 0%. 10 people started the trial, but nobody paid. And due to that really low conversion from trial to paid, our gross profit is really bad. We lost nearly 80%. every money we spent nearly 60 euros. So something like 55 and we spend 60 euros in total that really low conversion is due to the fact that people start a trial but then don't see the real value because they can sell their trial something like two or three minutes just after starting it and I'm not lying on the onboarding or during the paywall. So I think they don't see the value. That's why I want to change two things. During the onboarding, I'll ask more questions to really target the users and create a for you section in the app to recommend some categories based on your answers during the onboarding. And I also create a tutorial. So when you finish the onboarding, you'll have a few screens explaining how the app works and how to change categories and so on. I'm done coding the new onboarding and the for you sections. So I'll just show you how it looks as before. You have different questions during the onboarding. What's your name? How old are you? What's your gender and so on then you'll have some more personal questions that I use to really target the user and try to recommend the best categories that will match his mood or current situations. Finally, I finished the onboarding. Now the tutorial starts. So welcome to Glow, I'll show you around and help you get started. The goal of this tutorial is just to show the category button and how it works. I made a bouncy animation to make the user tap on the category badge. As you can see there is a new section called "For You" which contains four categories. So let's select growth. Don't forget to install the widgets. And that's all for him. And now the whole UI appears. So that's how I actually onboard users now trying to explain the features. At the top, I added a like goal because I want users on their first session to really use the app to understand everything in it. It's really basic so you can understand everything in one minute. I submitted the app to AppReview two hours ago and it's already accepted by Apple. It went really quick. So I resumed the TikTok campaigns. I mean, I didn't resume it. I created a new one because I want to have a new learning phase with that new app, with the new onboarding and tutorial. to wait again for three days with a 30 euros daily budget. And this morning, I also created this analytics dashboard with cloud code to keep track of the key metrics like revenue per install, download to trial. And if we check the detailed view, we can see screen per screen during the onboarding where users quit the app. So I really know which screen should be removed or kept. I'll keep you updated in a few days, maybe when the TikTok ad campaign will have enough learning to be relevant. Today is day 32 and I was just thinking about what would happen if I translated all the ads in native languages. Because for now, all my ads and even the app is in English. But I'm targeting countries that don't speak natively English. For instance, let's say Norway, they speak Norwegian. What would happen if the ad was in Norwegian? And the second part of the question is what would happen if the app was translated to Norwegian? Would we have more conversion in-app? And through the ad, we already spent half the budget during the test campaign and now we resumed it for three days. So it will be the other 100 euros left. But I really want to test it. I received some direct messages through Reddit, some emails and some comments on YouTube asking about specific parts of developing a mobile app. And I thought about creating a Discord somewhere where I could share some resources about the idea, how to validate it, the design, the development and even the marketing part. Exactly like this video. The goal is also to talk every day about your project, where you're at and how we could help you. Maybe someone went through the exact same thing and could help you to debug, to create a better paywall or even to create some better ads. There will be a small onboarding with a few questions. Where are you in your app journey? So let's say currently building then what's your current MRR status? So not launched yet and. What do you need the most help with? Let's say marketing and growth. And when you arrive, it will give you different roles and people will be able to help you. And I've created different categories. So they're getting started the community one, the roadmap where I'll explain everything step by step to launch your own mobile app. And then the journey again, step by step, the idea, the design, the development, the paywall and monetization and the marketing and growth of the community will be able to talk there. and exchange the different tips, the different news, and we'll grow together. So if you want some help, motivation, and join a community, just join the Discord and we will spend time together. That's going to be pretty fun and we will learn a lot. I won't teach you how to make $1 million through your app because I never did. The goal is just to share knowledge and help each other to build a few thousand dollars per month app and just have fun through learning. Today is the end of day 34 and I have a really nice news. We've made nearly $160 by spending only 30 euros on ads. I resumed the campaign three days ago and I've only had three days free trial, so users converted today. The key learning is that trying to improve your onboarding can have a huge impact on sales. Talking about ads, I've spent nearly all the budget, so I spent 180 euros, six days at 30 euros per day. And as I told you, there is a TikTok promotion, that gave me 180 euros of free credits. If I spent 180, they actually gave me 172, which is nearly 180 for the next five to six days. We will only run on free credits for my ads, which will cost nothing and will be only profit. Talking about conversion, here is my user journey funnel for the 21st. And I think I can improve it just a bit because right now only 76% of people who installed the app completed the onboarding And that seems a bit low. I want to make it 80 or 85%. That way we will have more payroll shown and then probably more conversion at the end. I looked for tips online, and I found this article on Revenue Cat website which just explains how to fix your funnel. And from this article, there are two key things I want to implement to hopefully improve again the onboarding. The first thing is called commitment psychology, and it's used in apps like Flow. or Jolingo and headway where they ask you to commit. So just like here, tap to commit, committing to goals, boost motivation. And apparently doing this just before showing the payroll can improve dramatically the payroll conversion. So I'll add that. And I've also seen on these screenshots at the bottom right there, that there is a completion bar during the onboarding that I can see. completely missed. In my onboarding, users don't really know where they're at and adding this can really improve it. At least I think so. We will try that. I'll show you what I've implemented. So the first thing is the progress bar. You can now see at the top there is a progress bar that will fill during the onboarding, a regular thing that everyone thinks about, but I literally forgot to edit. And I think just that can really improve the onboarding completion. We will see tomorrow after I submit this app to AppReview. Now the commitment part, I literally copy pasted the example from Revenue Cat. So it looks like that. I, Arthur, will use Glow to feel more self-confident. And if you hold your finger, the fingerprints behind will just fill. And at the end, it shows the paywall. It's a three steps paywall. So it's really important during the onboarding that you show only one information per screen. The first one is only explaining that we offer three days free trial. The next one is there will be a reminder of the paywall. one day before and the next one, what you will get by subscribing. It's really important to explain to the user what you will get if you pay for it. And don't create one paywall with all this information. Just create different screens. That's really important because users won't read everything and they could miss an information. That's it for the onboarding. I built the app and send it to AppReview. And tomorrow we will see if the onboarding completion is just a bit better. Let me show you a quick tip. I was submitting my app to App Store Connect submitting my build to just add it to the App Store. But I'm using EIS submit and I'm only a free user, so I'm on the free tier queue, which is really long, sometimes one hour, sometimes even two hours. I looked for an alternative and there is this app called Transporter. It's an app from Apple. You just open it and sign in with your Apple account. Take the build you made and drag and drop the file on the Transporter app. At the end, you just have to click on the deliver button and this build will be sent to App Store Connect in something like five minutes. So you just skip the whole EIS queue, which is way faster if you're only submitting to App Store and not Play Store. With the end of day 35 and today we gained two new paying customers for a total of The new app version with the new onboarding got approved last night and it had a huge impact on onboarding completion because today we are at 83% and yesterday we were at 74%. So hopefully this trend will continue in the next few days. Also today, we got 10 premium purchases, which means that 10 users started a free trial. That's pretty good that I spent only 180 euros in that spend because it's approximately $200. So that's going to be way better for me to just track. everything in dollars. Today is day 36 and we made $164 of revenue. That's four new paying customers. Here is the user journey funnel for today, and we can see that onboarding completion went down just a bit. So I'll wait a few days to see if the trend continues or not. Talking about onboarding in the next few days, I'm going to test lots of things. I'll keep the ads running because it's driving really good traffic to the app. more than 200 downloads per day. But I think our stats are still a bit low. We could increase onboarding completion, but also really increase trial start rates. which is still really low. I'll try different things to improve the onboarding, like different messages, different screen orders, different paywalls. And when the combination seems pretty good, we will just increase ad spend to drive more revenue. From now on, the formula is pretty simple. Just try to improve the onboarding to drive more conversion and then spend more on TikTok ads to obviously make more revenue. To A/B test my different paywalls, I'm using the experiments feature from PostHog. I just created a new experiment. called onboarding. I created four variants, which is no pact. So I removed one specific screen, the full onboarding, obviously one with a bit less questions and another one with less questions, but at a different spot. And then you have to specify what kind of metrics do you want to track? I set it up two metrics, the onboarding completion rate and the onboarding conversion rate. That means that when new users arrives on the app, you will get a random variance. For instance, no pacts We will measure if he completes the onboarding and converts during the onboarding. With a huge pool of users, we're going to have lots of results and we will be able to measure which variant is the best. And that's going to be the one that we will pick for production later. Day 46, long time no see, but it feels really good because the last days were really interesting. I think my work starts to pay off. That's the part I love the most. You see some traction, so it seems it kind of works. You just... test new things through Abitest, then you gather some data, some feedbacks and then iterate on it. And that's the same cycle you have to repeat again and again. And really small changes like just swapping a few screens during onboarding can have a huge impact on your trial start rate or just revenue. I didn't run any ads during four days because I waited Apple review team to review the new app with the Abitest for the onboarding. And it got pretty long because the app got rejected the first time. So I had to submit it twice. During that time, I had a few trials through organic conversions. So one or two per day, which is a really really good sign. Now, let me show you how the ABI test looks like in post-hug. In a few days more than 300 people went through the onboarding and went through the ABI test. I had four variants: the control which is the basic onboarding flow, one without a specific screen, one with less personal questions and one without a few specific screens about personal plan. My primary metric was just onboarding completion, and we can see that the NOPAC variant was really better than the three other ones. And then if we look at onboarding conversion, so who started the trial through the onboarding process, we can see that again, the NOPAC is really better, but the less personal. So when I removed a few questions about you, like how do you feel right now and so on drove no conversion. So just three screens removed drove no conversion. And that's why you have to happy test because really small changes can change everything for your conversion and revenue. So these variants seems to be the best one. This is my App Store Connect page. And yesterday, I received a very cool email. Let me show you in the payments and financial reports. We got for the Amazing. Quick clarification on the challenge rules, because I said that I only use $200 of my own money for TikTok ads. And that's still true. I haven't spent a single dollar more than that. But the other thing with app revenue, when someone buys a subscription, I don't actually get the money right away. Apple holds it for 30 to 45 days before paying me out. So let's say I've made 50 euros from the app this week. This money exists and it's mine. but I can't touch it yet. So I'm just sitting there waiting while my ads could be running. What I did is basically I loaned myself the money. I fronted it from my own pocket temporarily, knowing that it's coming back when Apple pays out. This cash flow problem is actually so common that Revenue Cat announced they are building a feature to fix it. So they would do exactly what I'm doing to myself, but with their own money and they would take a percentage, obviously like a tax on the revenue you made, but they would give you the money instantly. Anyways, I just wanted to be transparent. Now let me show you the RevenueCat dashboard, what it looks like. Currently we have 22 active trials and 37 active subscriptions. Our MOO is only at $143 but our revenue is nearly $1,500. I think I'm going to keep this challenge going until we hit $2,000 in profits not revenue in one single month. I'm going to keep testing for at least one week because I want to be test prices, paywalls and finish the onboarding test. But honestly it's getting repetitive and I think the core lesson is done from here is just scaling. So doing the exact same thing but just with bigger numbers, bigger ad spends so bigger revenue and reinvest reinvest and reinvest. I'll show you how to make $2,000 of profit per month but continuing feels like more of the same. Let's get back to the intro. Interesting things. I'm going to show you my current payroll, which is this one. It looks like that. And I just show you how your free trial works. This one works pretty well from my statistics and I've created a second variance, which is the claim variance. It's really similar, but, the, the box here changed and I just copied this one from this video from SuperRule. SuperRule is exactly like Revenue Cat, but they have a really cool podcast where they show everything about apps and interview different people. And I copied this paywall. Let me show you how it looks because I thought it looked really nice and could really fit our onboarding. I'm going to ABI test the paywall too, and to ABI test with RevenueCat, you just go to the experiments tab, create a new experiment so you can name it, then select the experiment type. This one is going to be a paywall design. You choose the primary metric which is initial conversion rate, enrollment criteria, everyone. And then you select the two variants you want to ABI test and RevenueCat will just exactly like post-hug send different paywalls to different users and measure the impact. This morning I discovered a new TikTok ads feature. I just wanted to show you. I've made a basic script, which just analyze the trial repartition on every day. It looks like that. So I store all my RevenueCat data on my computer the different trial distribution by hour with my current time zone. And that way I can see when I'm converting the most and knowing that when you go on TikTok ads on the budget and schedule part, you can go to more option and select specific time of the day. I've selected the best time for me. And that way my ads are only running on those times, which should maximize the conversion. That's a quick tip. I found that I'm not really sure it that works. But I thought that was pretty smart to test. And the last thing I want to show you, which is Apple ads. I don't know what I did wrong, but it's not working and it's not spending any money. I've tried different CPT bid and I think I just have to wait. Maybe my keywords aren't very smart. I don't know. But I got only four downloads or now this is not working. I mean, that was free money, so we don't care. But yeah, that's not the best strategy I ever tried. That's it for today. I showed you lots of things. I'm going to keep the ads running and I really want to just reach the $2,000 of profits for the last 28 days. I'm going to keep updating you and show you how it goes. Hey, so today is day 49 and I wanted to change a bit because in the last few days I worked a lot for school. That's soon the Christmas holidays and I have lots of homework about my internship and some papers to do. So I wanted to dedicate a few hours today to ship a new feature. The feature is pretty basic. It's called practice, and you want to have some voice reading some affirmations for you in a story like UI. That's pretty simple. Let's go coding. To create this feature, I'm going to use a model called a text-to-speech model because I want to give some AI model some text, like the affirmation text, and I'm going to have back some audio file containing a robot just reading the text I gave him. Every day when you open the app, I'm going to download the last audio files from Superbase that are generated with the Gemini API. I was submitting my app to AppReview and I wanted to show you one small setting that I changed a few days ago on App Store Connect that literally made me some money. So when you go in subscriptions, you have the billing race period. And actually this was switched off. I made it to three days billing problem like the credit card didn't work or any kind of problem. Apple will just try again to charge the credit card in three days and during that time, the customer just keep the premium or free trial and that's just how it works. So when sometimes the billing isn't working for whatever reason, it just tries to charge again one day after and another day after. Just switching this on made me three or four new subscriptions which is amazing because... I did nothing more. It just tried to charge again when there was some error. Also, I changed the name to be even more explicit so now it's Glow Daily Affirmations and nothing more. Talking about keywords let me show you how Astro looks like currently. My rankings are getting better every day but i'm still not perfect at all and in some countries like Denmark i'm pretty good that's why i have some natural downloads every day because my rankings are getting better every day I also ended the onboarding ABI test on post hoc, and that's the no pack version that got the most conversions. So that's the one that I kept on my own botting. For instance, yesterday we got 136 downloads and 17 free trials started, which is pretty good. That means that 12.5% of. of users that installed the app, started a trial. And currently today we only had 29 downloads, but we have six new trials started, which is a 20.6% conversion rate from all the people who downloaded the app, which is even better. The onboarding looks pretty good. I'm really happy with those results and I'm just going to keep updating and trying to improve it even more until the Christmas holidays. I'm submitting the new app to AppReview And I really hope this new feature will drive even more trials. We're going to see. I'll keep you updated, obviously. Today is day 54 and we've made three conversions so far. So that's more than $120 for one single day. And yesterday was my best day so far. I've made seven conversion in one single day, which is just impressive actually. And that's more than $278. I don't know if you remember, but a few weeks ago when I tried organic marketing, I've made different posts on Reddit and one on the Expo subreddit. And I've had the Expo team commenting and just said, oh, you could wrote an article about the widgets that could be really interesting. And guess what? Yesterday, really late at night in France, the article went out. So I have my own article on the Expo blog, which is crazy again. I just talk about how I implemented widgets. It's pretty basic article, but still really cool. And the Expo team was so cool. They even sent me a free t-shirt and obviously I asked for an internship. We never know. I've also started the experiment. So to test different payroll variants here is how it looks so far. The B variant is apparently the best one so far. I'm going to wait again more than 50 conversion per paywall to know which one is the best, apparently that's what Revenue Cat records. Also, here is the current dashboard. So our current stats revenue nearly $2,100 looking pretty good. And talking about Abitest, I also learned a few days ago that you could Abitest your app store front page. So that's on App Store Connect on product page optimization. And you can create a test. I'd like to only test the app icon. Apparently it can have a huge impact. So let's see. I've made three, four tests. I'm just going to create the test. I mean, I'm not sure about that one, but you know what? Let's test. Tomorrow, I'd like to show you the different TikToks videos that I've made so you can see what worked and what didn't. Day 55. So first thing first, the Revenue Cat dashboard. We have 39 active trials, 61 active subscriptions and 2,400 revenue in the last 28 days. And today I wanted to show you the different activities. ads that I ran and which one worked the best. Let me show you my TikTok. So I tried lots of formats, really lots of them. The one that worked the best in terms of cost per click, so the one that cost me the less to have one download was this one at less than 10 cents per download, which is crazy good. It looks like that. There is a rhythmic music and a default iOS wallpaper with the earth and the sun moving around it. depending on the time of the day. This one worked really well too. I just took a video from YouTube and added the exact same thing with the earth just after it, with another trendy music. And the last format which worked also pretty well was this one. I actually paid a girl $20 per video and she made three videos of five seconds. It worked really well because it's TikTok native format like vertical screen and so on. I tried really lots of different formats, even Pinterest videos like glow up in one month. These formats work crazy well, like the cost per click is freaking low, but I couldn't get downloads after the click. So my app isn't what people were waiting for after clicking on it. But if you have a glow up app, just try these formats. That's freaking amazing. It works so well. I tried different type of Pinterest glow up things and all All of them worked really well with a very low cost per click. So try it by yourself if you have an app matching that kind of format. Tomorrow, I'll make different videos to just show you step-by-step exactly how to set up the subscriptions, how to set up App Store Connect dashboard and Revenue Cat and everything. The different setups can be really tricky sometimes. So that's why I'm really happy with what I'm building because I'm sure it will help you. And I think I'm going to create a new app from scratch, especially for the Discord. Because I want to build with you so we will be all together starting from scratch or from different steps. I think that can be really interesting. I'm really hyped by all this and start again a new app with other community. That's going to be pretty sick. I bought the AppSprint domain name and in a few days I'll create a very basic landing page for all of that to look pretty clean. Day 56. Let's start with Revenue Cat 0. Maybe just TikTok ads. I had this new coupon, like 100 euros for free again. I think TikTok ads really wants to keep their customers. So they offer you lots of free ad credits at the beginning. And then when you start spending, they stop to give you free ad credits. But we had again, 100 euros of free ad credits, which is approximately something like $115. Crazy good. Again, we won't spend that much on ads. I mean, We used lots of credits, but it wasn't that expensive. Then for the Revenue Cat part, here is the current dashboard. So we are at 46 trials, 66 active subscriptions and the revenue is nearly 2600. Today I also filmed some parts of the course. So I filmed this one about how to set up your revenue cap dashboard, how to set up your App Store Connect dashboard, how to link them because it could be quite challenging. So I'm uploading all of that to YouTube, the Discord for you to have access to it. So yeah, pretty good day. The revenue is steady like every day we have between five and seven, eight conversion, which is amazing. We have a really, really good download to trial conversion. Let me show you today. Okay. we had 50 downloads, 50 onboarding completed. Amazing And 8 conversions, 8 trials started. So that means that we have a 16% conversion from download to trial, which is again really nice. I think we might have the sweet spot. The onboarding is pretty good. The payroll is pretty good. Everything Yeah, everything seems to work. Today is day 57 and that might be our last day together because I think we hit our threshold of $2,000 of profit. Right now we are at $2,800 of revenue in the last 28 days and I think it's a bit more than the $2,000 of profit. So let me create a notion and show you all the different stats, our current conversion rate, our current trial rate and everything so you know in details where we at. I've made three lines. The green one is the profit, the blue one, the revenue, and the red one, the ad spent. The revenue is simply the money that users paid. The profit is the revenue minus Apple cut, which is 15% minus ad spent. So that's actually the money left in my pocket at the end. We've made a really good profit because I had lots of free credits on ads at $35 per day so that would have been a $700 of ad spent but I had two coupons on the TikTok Ads dashboard so two times they gave me free credits the first time $210 and the second time $150 so nearly half the ad spent was actually free credits from TikTok and I also spent $60 for the three videos to pay the girl on TikTok and yeah I have my different videos. I think the best things to remember from this experiment is just only optimize your onboarding, try to spend nearly 90% of your time on the onboarding. Just try to improve every step, every conversion during the onboarding, because that's where all the money is left, like more than 80% of conversions or during the onboarding so work on that. Trust me, that's way more important than the app itself. That seems crazy, but yeah. That's the case and switch on the grace period. I mean, I had lots of money coming from that nearly 10% of the revenue is coming from that. So trust me, turn on that just grace period. You'll gain some money now with the interesting numbers. My current download to trial rate is in average more than 14%. And my trial to pay rates is a bit more than 31%, which is also pretty good. So that means that if I have 100 downloads. I will have 14 trials started and at the end, 4 trial conversions. I'll earn $164 for 100 downloads. That means that for every download, I earn $1.64. I also wanted to show you my different reviews. I have 55 ratings in total with like good ones. I got premium for free because on the Reddit campaigns, I offered those but Yeah, some really, really nice ratings. We are currently at 4.7 out of 5, which is quite good. So I'm happy with that. If you watch this video so far, I'm pretty sure that you have an idea of any kind of project sitting in the back of your head. Maybe a nap, maybe a website or something completely different, like creating a wooden table. It actually doesn't matter. And I know what you're thinking because I was there too. Like, I don't know enough. I start later, but that's not the right mindset. I've built things that nobody used. I spent lots of money on things that didn't work. I tried and failed a lot, but that's exactly how I learned. I didn't know anything. I started something, learned in the process, failed, learned from that failure. And again and again, learning by doing and failing is actually the best way of learning. And don't try to build anything just for the result. Like if you want to be rich or create something, I don't know, revolutionary, don't work only for the result. Trust me. You have to enjoy the whole process, enjoy learning, enjoy failing because you'll spend lots of time just in the process and spend a little, little time at the end like at the result. So if you want your life to be enjoyable, trust me, you have to enjoy the process. Try to fall in love with learning because at the end, I truly think that that's the only way to make it sustainable and worth it. All right, that's it. See you in the next one.

## Transcription

So you want to get rich, That bank account is looking a bit empty, isn't it? Let's fix that with a little program. Imagine all you have to do is go to your bank account, right click, select inspect element and change the amount of money you have. And there you go. Ladies and gentlemen, we're officially rich. It's that easy. I'll see you on the next one. next video. All right, all right, enough jokes. You want to get rich from programming, which means you're different from other people. You don't want a regular job. You're a hustler. You want to break the system, escape the matrix. Well, don't worry, buddy. In this video, I'm going to show you how to program apps that actually make money. I'm going to guide you through the process of how to get an idea, how to code it and how to market it. Trust me, I'm an expert at this. Disclaimer. This person is an unemployed loser. He has no experience whatsoever. Viewer discretion is advised. That was weird. So the app idea. Let's get one thing straight. Our goal here is to get rich, not build the next billion dollar company. All we need to do is create a project that pays your rent and your random DoorDash orders. This makes our job 10 times easier because now we don't have to build some project that'll solve a problem for humanity. We just have to build a project that fuels our greed. Okay this is starting to sound a bit unethical. Maybe we should do something- Oh money Now that we've sold our soul to capitalism, we can use my secret business strategies for project ideas. This looks like a pyramid. Wait a minute. Strategy #1: Solve a problem so small, so stupidly specific that nobody else bothers. Let me give you a beautiful example. I have a problem and I assume other people have the same problem. I get a lot of emails, promotions, alerts, reminders, and of course, emails from people who reply to my newsletter Slothbytes. Oh, you don't know what Slothbytes is? Slothbytes is my weekly newsletter where I share bite-sized programming information every week to make you a better programmer. And the best part about it? It's free All you have to do is give me your email. I won't do anything with it. I promise. *laughs* So yeah, my emails get a lot of stuff and I'm too lazy to categorize them. So you can make a project that categorizes emails and I bet you could charge $5 a month for this. Get 1,000 users and bam $5,000 a month. Wait, this already exists? Ah, strategy number two: solve a problem so big and common that it doesn't matter if another one exists. Look, maybe the email thing has already been done, but that doesn't mean it won't work. Think about it: calendar apps, password managers, note-taking apps, to-do apps. There's like 500 of them. But guess what? They still make that money Your idea doesn't have to be good or original. That's right. In fact, you can even just copy and paste someone else's idea. Big companies are a master of this. Check this out: DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub, Rappi. Holy, there's a lot of food delivery apps. Strategy number three: The X for Y formula. Look, since we can copy businesses, We can use this classic strategy to make it look like we're doing something original. The strategy is pretty simple. The X is the specific problem or need that you're trying to solve. And then the Y is the specific group of people or market that you're trying to sell to. So imagine something like the Discord for businesses, Linux, but for normal people, Uber Eats, but you take people. Wait, that's just Uber. Look, it's a simple strategy. I obviously don't have any good ideas or else I'd be rich. But you get the point, right? This strategy is really effective if you have absolutely no creative. Strategy number four, the GPT wrapper. This is a brand new strategy thanks to ChatGPT and other AIs. And the strategy is pretty simple. You make AI do a specific task. Yeah, it's that simple. And some people have made millions off this, like my homie Blake Anderson right here. You know what he made? RizGPT. GPT for dating. He made millions off this. Yeah, millions. Business is such a beautiful thing. Now, even if you have an idea, thanks to my four strategies, it doesn't really matter if you don't know how to build it. So let me show you how to start building these apps. You see, most developers have problems here. They get stuck and it's not because they can't build it. In fact, it's the opposite. They can build it, but they want everything to be perfect. They want to keep adding features. They're worried about scaling. Bro, you have zero users. What's the point of scaling? Because while you're worried about clean code, scalability and best practices, someone else is launching their broken app, getting real users... and making money with code that looks like it was written by a three-year-old. But thanks to modern tools, shipping garbage has never been easier. But I'll get to that part later. When you're building your project, it should follow these three rules. LC. Simple, lovable and complete. I stole this from a video from Edmund Young but I just love the advice so much so I'm gonna steal it here. I'm sorry Edmund, it's such good advice. Simple means that your app doesn't have to do everything but it should at least deliver at least one to two key features. Lovable means you want people to use your app so this just means your app should have some good UI/UX. So basically make your app look good. I'll talk more about that later. And your app should be complete. Don't make your app like the gaming industry where it's incomplete. complete and then sell you it later. Make sure it's functional. Make sure the one to two key features you did make work. Once again, I'm taking this from Edmund. So go check out his videos later. Not now. You should watch mine first. Now I want to emphasize the L in SLC, lovable, because I don't think enough of you understand how important this part is, especially the programmers, specifically backend engineers. I'm looking at you. Please make your project look good or at least not terrible. It's bad enough that you're ugly. Don't make your project ugly too. Most of you probably only care about the programming part. You want to get things done, even if it looks ugly. And I respect that, but you're trying to sell this project to other people. Here's the thing about us humans. We're shallow. There. You could have the best code ever written, revolutionary features. But if it looks ugly? Nobody's gonna use it. I mean there's exceptions of course like craigslist and uh craigslist. Craigslist just looked a little better. Design is really important. Now you could spend years learning design, studying UI patterns, taking screenshots of every app to learn how to make a good looking website, or you could use this tool to help you out. Mobin. Now what's Mobin? Mobin's a really useful tool for design and I'm so happy a platform like this exists. You can think of them like the paparazzi for design because they take pictures of everything. Maubin don't get mad at that. And they're also the sponsor of today's video. I knew it It's a platform that lets you look at websites and mobile apps to get some design inspiration and see how other applications do things. Let me give you some quick facts about Maubin that'll blow you away. They have over 1,200 apps, over 500,000 screenshots, and over 80,000 user flows. Yeah, it's a cheat code for design. It's updated every single week and their mission is to empower the world to design great digital experiences. So basically Maubin wants to make every website and app look good. You can check out how other companies do signups, logins, their homepage, dashboards, checkouts, really anything. A lot of designers rely on Mobin as a source of inspiration and best practices because well, they have everything. I mean, look how easy this is. I need a landing page. I go on Mobin. Boom, this is how 500 apps did their landing page. It's quick and easy to find exactly what you need. No more random screenshots, no more guessing what works. Mobin already has everything for you. And you might even learn a thing or two about UI UX. So if you'd like to try Mobin for free and start making beautiful projects, click the link in the description. Now that we have our design cheat code and I sold my soul a bit, let's get a bit more technical and start building. Your application is going to need four parts: front end, the back end, database, and a payment processor. And when people think of these four steps, they usually have to think of a tech stack. Ah yes, the tech stack. A landmine full of opinions. Now when it comes to tech stack specifically to make money, your tech stack doesn't really matter. The only people that care about your tech stack are tech bros on Twitter. It's X now. I'm not saying that. And they're not gonna buy your product. They're gonna build it themselves so you could honestly use whatever you want. WordPress, Scratch, JavaScript, Python. You can write your app in COBOL for all I care. The only thing that matters is if your app works. The only recommendations I will give you about a tech stack is use something that's popular, that has a lot of developer support, has a large community, and that you're the most comfortable with. At the end of the day, if you can't get any work done, what's the point? Now, what I like to use personally, and this is specifically for web development, I like to use Next.js and Supabase, and I like to style my apps with ChatCN and Tailwind. I love chatzion. And then I like to use post-hoc for analytics to track you all. And then I use stripe for payment processing so I can take all your money. Yeah, that's the tech stack I like to use right now. This could change in the future because there's a lot of tools and frameworks out there that I haven't used personally, but this does get the job done. It's up to you if you want to use it. Remember when I said shipping garbage has never been easier? This is what I meant. Now, AI is not perfect. and people have mixed opinions about it for programming. My advice would be if the goal of this project is to learn, I don't recommend using it. But in our case, it's to sell out and make money. So who cares? Now, obviously, AI isn't perfect. It's not going to give you the entire project yet. But I will say it's very helpful to get stuff done fast. Specifically annoying stuff. AI is a very helpful tool no matter how you look at it. Now there's levels to how you can use AI. We got the normie level, which is just the basic AI chats like chat GPT, Plod, Gemini. Does anyone actually use the Gemini chat? And then we have the try hard sweat level, which are using tools that are specifically made for coding. There's tools like Bolt, V0 and lovable that basically build the full stack application. They obviously can't build the entire thing, but they do give a good starting point. I mean, check this out. I'll use Bolt for this. You give a description of what you want and Bolt just builds it for you. Oh my God. There's also AI code editors like Cursor, Windsurf, and Pear. Shout out Ning. AI inside your code editors might become the norm soon, at least for non-enterprise projects because they're really helpful. It's great, you should check out one of these AI code editors. But uh, where was I? Alright, how to make projects that make money. You now have your app idea that'll make you millions? All you have to do now is build it. Let me give you the ultimate workflow so you can finish that app in a week. Step 1. Get a description and outline of the project. Go to ChatGPT, describe the project you want to make, and tell ChatGPT to create a detailed and structured explanation of the app because you don't even know what you're building yourself yet. Step 2. Use an AI tool like V0, Bolt, or... or lovable and copy and paste that detailed explanation to one of those tools. It'll start building it for you and give you a good starting point. Step three, fix the UI. These tools are most likely going to generate terrible UI so what you can do now is go onto Mobbin and look at any designs that you think look good, copy the images from Mobbin and paste them into the tool that you use to build the app and tell it to make it look like that. Step four, start programming it yourself even though you have a starting point these tools are not gonna build the whole thing for you. You actually have to use your brain and code it yourself. So yoink the code that it gave you, and start coding. And there you go my friend You now have a starting point to making your next million dollar application. Now that you finished the project, all you have to do now is wait, and the users will start coming. Where's the user? Marketing Now even though you've finished building your project, you'd think people would just visit it normally. But Well, you're wrong. Even once you finish building your project and you publish it to the internet, literally nothing happens. Absolutely nothing. Nobody knows it exists. Nobody's going to use it. Your mom's not going to use it. Your dad's not going to use it. Your uncle's not going to use it. Your grandma's not going to use it. Your project goes straight to the void of the internet, which is why we need marketing. All you need to do is be slightly annoying, kind of everywhere, and a little bit cringe. And there's already a place that does exactly that. Social media. Reddit, free users. Twitter, free marketing. LinkedIn, free customers. You have to start start thinking like a business person. You got to stop thinking about people as people. You have to start looking at them as numbers and money. Go on LinkedIn and post about your entrepreneurship journey and link your project, and people are going to eat that stuff up. It's that simple nowadays. Go on TikTok, post some cringe TikToks about your product, and people are bound to see it. Go on YouTube, post some terrible videos about your product. People are bound to see it. Even if your video gets a little views, you could just buy ads and people will have to see it because you paid for it. So keep posting about your project, keep being annoying, and people will eventually try it. Now combine social media marketing with SEO, search engine optimization, fix up your HTML and add some metadata to your project, get your project to the top of Google searches. You already know what I'm going to say. People are bound to see it. And if your product actually is good, it'll get popular. and people will actually buy it. And you'll finally be rich and live your dream life. And if you successfully get rich from this video, split me the check because you owe me. I made you.

# I cloned 3 apps and now make $35K/month

## Transcription

My name is Samuel and I run three apps making $35,000 per month. You might think you need to come up with a completely new idea, but I just met a guy who does the exact opposite. His strategy is simple: 1. Find an app that's working, and 2. Make it 1% better. If it's already successful, I know it's validated. But don't be fooled. He's not just copying and pasting. And in this episode, he breaks down his meticulous method for finding winning ideas and turning them into successful apps. We'll get into where the best ideas are hiding in plain sight, how to validate fast so you don't waste months working on a failed project, and the playbook for researching and replicating successful apps that you can put into practice today. All right let's dive in. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. All right welcome Samuel to the channel. Thanks for coming on. Tell me about who you are and what's your story? So my name is Samuel Rondeau. I used to have a full-time job, but I quit it a few years ago and I taught myself to code on YouTube. And now I run three SaaS apps that are making $35,000 per month. Okay, cool. So before we get into all your apps and how they grew, you said that you actually taught yourself how to code. How did you do that? And could you break that down for us? So yeah, actually I used to be an optician and I had a zero coding experience. At the time I wanted to rebuild a tool I was using for Instagram but this time I wanted to build it myself using code. I ended up following a 15-hour course on YouTube and every time I learned something new in the course I immediately tried to apply it to that tool I was building. So if you just watch a course most of the time it's not enough because you end up losing yourself in languages you will probably never use and you don't really see why you are learning what you are learning. But yeah, it all started like this, following a YouTube course, and it quickly became a passion for me. Cool Alright, well, for anyone watching this today who wants to learn how to code, how to build apps, what would be your advice? What would be your framework or playbook on how you'd get started? If I were 18 years old now, I don't think I would learn to code the traditional way. I would probably just use AI coding tools and with AI today you can literally build like 90% of most apps. So my framework today would be: 1 Pick a real project, 2 Ask ChatGPT what you need to learn to build it. So for example, you go on Google or on Twitter and you find the product you like and you take a screenshot of that page and you ask ChatGPT "How can I build just the landing page to start?" And 3 Build step by step asking ChatGPT for help at each roadblock. I would of course ask him to use modern technologies like Next.js, Node.js. That's awesome What I really want to talk about is ideas and finding successful ideas. You have multiple successful products and you share with me your strategy for how you found those. Could you tell me a little bit more about that? I'm someone a bit lazy and I don't have unlimited energy so I have one rule that is really crucial for me: It's to never build something that doesn't already exist and isn't already successful. or at least getting some traction. So this way I reduce my chance of failure and I increase my chances of success. So usually to find products idea, my number one source of ideas is Twitter, especially around communities like Solopreneur, Indiehacker, Biddingpublics etc. And then I look for things that are working or products that I personally like. Here are my four keys filter: Number 1: I would use it myself. Number 2: I can see that it already works. And 3: they are not spending thousands on marketing meaning there is a true demand. And four, the product is simple enough to maintain. If your product passes this filter, then usually I'm confident towards building it. Okay, let's go a little bit deeper on that. When you come across ideas online, what is the actual criteria that you're looking at? What are some of the numbers and websites and things that you look at to know if this is worth building and if this is validated? So first, the most important thing, I look for traction. The best signal you can find on Twitter is when founders share their MRL screenshots or Stripe screenshots. I know that sounds basic, but honestly it's the ultimate proof that the tool is working and that people are paying for it. Second, I analyze how they are getting their customers. So I use Ahrefs to check their traffic sources. Are they getting customers only from ads? Or are they also ranking on SEO? If they are growing with both ads and SEO, that's a very good sign because it shows a strong demand and it's usually easier to replicate the success. If I rely mostly on SEO, it can be harder because SEO takes time but it's still doable if I'm patient. And third, I check if the product is technically something I can build and maintain easily. I don't want to build a product that will make me lose sleep maintaining a complex backend. Simplicity is very important for me. And finally, I ask myself: do I actually like the product? Because there's nothing worse than working on a project you don't care about. If I don't enjoy it, Using it myself, I won't have the motivation to keep going long term. So in short, traction first analyze traffic sources, check if I can build it easily and make sure I like the product. That strategy is cool and it's amazing to have it kind of all boiled down. But I want to hear how it actually applied to your actual apps that you built. How did that strategy specifically work? So actually, the first real app I built was Use Artemis. And at that time, I didn't use that strategy and it was a mistake because I ended up building an email finding tool that have for competitors big names like Apollo, Lemlist and stuff like that. And it was so difficult to maintain. So after Use Artemis I really decided to build something that will be easier to maintain and that's how I ended up building StoryShort. So I saw a post from a guy building a tool to automate posting faceless video on YouTube, TikTok etc. And the numbers were crazy. So I started to investigate: is it hard to build? And where is the traffic coming from? The really good thing with this one is all the traffic was from Facebook ads, which means I can replicate it literally in a week. Because Facebook ads you just have to start it and you have the traffic. So I went for it, I built the tool, launched ads and StoryShort AI grew very fast. So with StoryShort it was 100% the process I described earlier. I validated the idea, I saw there a clear demand, it was simple product and it was a market I was personally interested in. All right, before we finish talking about how Samuel grew his apps to $34,000 per month, let's talk about something a lot of solo founders struggle with: design. You've got a working idea, you know it solves a problem, but suddenly you've wasted hours taking screenshots just to figure out how to make your app look good. That's where Mobin comes in. Mobin is the world's largest library of real-world mobile and web app designs. Over 1.7 million people from Airbnb designers, to indie devs use it to find inspiration, study flows and build smarter not slower. You can search thousands of actual product screens by keyword flow or even style. Whether you need an onboarding flow paywall layout or just a clean signup form Mobin shows you exactly how the best apps do it so you don't have to start from scratch. Whether you're building your first app or your 10th it's a massive time saver. Just click the first link in the description to check out Mobin. Thank you to Mobin for sponsoring this video. All right, let's get back to Samuel. All right. So I mean, on that note, can you break down the three different businesses that you've built that are all successful? Okay. So I built useartemis.co. It's a LinkedIn scrapping tool that is making around $15,000 per month and has around 10,000 customers. I have storieshow.ai, which is an AI video generator for TikTok and YouTube that is making around $20,000 per month and has around 4,000 customers. And Capacity.so, which is brand new, it's an AI coding tool that is making currently $900 per month and has around 50 users. Okay, that's awesome. So we talked about the ideas, we talked about the framework for finding ideas. Let's talk about what everyone wants to hear about, which is once you find the idea, how do you grow the business? What growth strategies are you using and how do you know which ones to do? So I always start by running ads. It's always the first thing I do. So I do it on Google and Meta, depending on the product. Sometimes it's better on Google, sometimes it's better on Meta. It's the fastest way to validate and test the market. And as soon as I get some traction with ads, I move to the second part of the growth which is SEO. I think too many apps rely only on ads and never got a single visitor from Google. Of course, SEO takes time but once it works, it's almost free traffic and it compounds. I also use faceless YouTube channels to grow my apps I even created a feature inside StoryShort for this. The idea is that StoryShort will automatically publish daily UGC style video about your product on YouTube channels, TikTok and Instagram. You can create multiple channels that talk about your products every day on autopilot. So depending on your niche, this can bring crazy results over time. It works really well. And finally, I do affiliate marketing. I did it for all those three apps, especially on StoryShort. It's super important because not only does it bring clients to the store, but it also brings customers to the store. at a fixed cost, but it also creates virality because I have many people doing YouTube videos about StoryShort, writing articles. So it brings zero results and people are more likely to share the product if they earn a commission. So in short, my growth stack is 1 start with ads, 2 build SEO as soon as there's traction, 3 use faceless YouTube channel to drive attention on TikTok and Instagram, and 4 run an affiliate program to boost virality and get customers at a fixed price. Alright, cool. Well on a similar note let's talk about tech stack. I know you don't come from a software engineering background but what stack do you build your apps in and how do you deploy these? So all my apps I built with Next.js and Node.js for the coding part. I use Ahrefs for the SEO analysis, and I use also AI tools for writing articles, so for the SEO. So I was using SEOpital which is really great, but now I just switched to a new one called Outrank.so. It really automates the writing of article posted automatically on your blog, and I use Vercel for deploying my apps, Stripe for payments, and yeah, that's it. That's great. On a similar note, people who are watching and probably wondering, okay, you're telling us how much money your business is making, but what's the profit? What's the cost to run this business and how profitable are these? Well, Use Artemis cost me around $4,000 per month and StoryShort cost me around $5,000 per month. So it costs a bit less than Use Artemis because Use Artemis, you have to run instances to automate many things. So it's quite expensive. And capacity, I can't tell yet, but it will be quite expensive because we have to run instances to deploy a website each time. Cool. You've built a bunch of successful businesses. Some things have worked, some things haven't. What did you learn while building those businesses that surprised you? What really surprised me is that you don't need to innovate. You just need to see what is working on AX in communities, on forums and build your own alternative, your own version of the product. If you like the product and see that it's working... Just clone the idea, build an MVP in two weeks and launch ads immediately. I think people are always overcomplicated this but simple boring tools are what makes the most of money I think. Great. And last question that we ask everyone who comes onto the channel. If you could go back in time and stand on Samuel's shoulder when you were an optician, what advice would you give him to get started to build apps and make money online? My first advice is Would be of course to use AI coding tools. At that time there was no coding tool but today you can use so many AI coding tools that I think that I wouldn't have learned to code. Two would be spend time learning Google Ads and Meta, even X ads, there are many ads you can learn. Three, launch as soon as possible, skip the boring parts of building a SaaS like the password reset pages, setting pages. Just launch the minimal basic products and run ads to test demand right away. Once you get traction, focus on SEO. It will bring compounding free traffic over time. And even if one day you want to sell the tool, having SEO traffic is also very valuable. And automate as much as you can. Use automation tools like Outrank, StoryShot, etc. to automate posting, article creation, as much as you can. Finally, once you have growth and customers coming daily, I would finish the product, bring new features, etc. All right, well... That's great advice. I love your strategy. I love the business that you're building. Thank you for coming on the channel, Samuel. And I hope everyone watching this learned something and are going to build cool stuff because of it. Thanks for coming on. Thanks, bud. I love Samuel's story because it goes to show that you don't need to invent a brand new idea. You can go find something that's already working and just make it a little bit better. With the right process and the right approach, anybody can build something successful. In Inside Starter Story Build, We'll show you how to build apps the right way. In just two weeks, you'll find an idea, build it with AI and ship it out into the world. Over 1000 people have already joined and shipped their first apps. So if you want to finally bring your idea to life, head to the link in the description and check out Starter Story Build.

## Transcription

I'm 23 years old and my apps do over a million dollars in sales a year. This is Connor, a 23-year-old kid who cracked the code on building apps that actually make money. I built my latest app in less than two weeks 100% with AI. To prove it he joined a hackathon of over 55,000 people, built an app from scratch, grew it to $20,000 a month, and won the entire thing. The apps that I build are designed to make money from day one. I asked Connor to come onto the channel to break down his entire playbook for building money-making apps fast. And in this episode, we will dive into how he finds validated ideas that can make money from day one, exactly how he vibe codes these apps quickly and his step-by-step playbook on how to grow them into money making machines. Strap in because this is an episode you cannot miss. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. All right, welcome Connor to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built and what's your story? Hi, I'm Connor and over the past few years, I've built a handful of mobile apps. These apps have done over a million in revenue now. I really only got into entrepreneurship roughly three years ago just by watching YouTube videos and staying optimistic on what I'm building. Okay, Connor, that's amazing. Can you share with me what types of apps that you've built? So I've built a bunch of different apps. I probably got around six apps now. My most recent app is called Payout. And this is one that I just recently launched in the beginning of August and just scaled it up to doing 20,000 a month in revenue. The downloads is over 12,000, over 1,300 new subscriptions. One cool thing is this is part of the Revenue Cat Chip-a-Ton competition. It's a hackathon that people can release new apps to the App Store. This year it had over 55,000 entrants and it won first place for the Build & Grow Award. which has a total grand prize of $65,000 for the app that has the most growth over the two-month period. Before we get into the app and how you built it, I got to understand a little bit more about your background. I know you're only 23 years old and it's pretty impressive what you've done. So tell me how you get to this place where you even start building apps? So before I started building apps, I was just any other kid playing too much video games, staying up late. no computer science background. One night in the middle of the night, I woke up and I just had a random app idea. And I wrote down the whole app idea in my notes. You know, I'd never coded anything. The next morning I woke up and I just started watching YouTube videos and I didn't have a MacBook at the time and I really wanted to make an iOS app. And I didn't really have any money. So I started doing random tasks, just like selling random items around my room. And eventually, like, I got my hands on a old MacBook. I started building a social app called Hotspot Events. This app took me six to eight months to build. Kind of failed. I really had no idea what I was doing. After that first app, I quickly realized that apps that are social are super hard to scale. So I eventually moved on to utilities and tools, and these are much more easy to scale as a one man person. This was all about three years ago. And since then I've scaled these apps are doing over a million subscription revenue. Okay. I mean, that's amazing. I love that you did this without having all the crazy tools or anything like that. So my next question for you is how do you build these apps? What is your playbook for building these apps? How do you think about building an app from scratch? Yeah. Before I get into how I do things today, I think it's important that people know that you don't need all these fancy tools. I was just watching YouTube videos and going on Stack Overflow. And now my process today is pretty straightforward. I have a very specific set of steps that I follow to make sure that the app I'm building has ability to convert, drive a lot of sales, also have really good user retention. My first step is that I'll go and download a whole bunch of apps, maybe 20 apps that are in the niche that I'm diving into, as well as other apps that I just think are beautiful apps that I want to draw inspiration from for their design perspective. The next thing I do is screenshot every single page in every single onboarding. And I take all these screenshots and I'll put them all on one big line in a Figma file. So I can see all of the onboardings, every question they ask, every graph they have. And I'll pick out all the ones that I like and I'll grab some from one, some from another. And then I'll redesign them. So I'll have my theme and my aesthetic that I want for my app. I think it's really important to have an extensive onboarding. Realistically, 90% of users will probably only ever see your onboarding if you have a paywalled section in your app. So I think it's really important that you spend a lot of time on this, maybe even as much time as designing the actual functionality of the app. When it comes to the onboarding. These are the most important things that you want to do to make sure that your app converts successfully. The first one is you want to invoke emotion. You want to make sure that when the user's going through the onboarding, they feel strongly about it. Most purchases are made emotionally and are not logical when it comes to consumers. You also want to make sure that you show the strongest incentives of your app, how it's going to improve your users life. You want to make sure that they understand the benefits and that it's very simple for them to be able to make that purchase. It's also important to make sure that the app feels personalized. In today's day and age when there's so much competition, people want to make sure that what they're buying feels like it's meant for them specifically rather than just a generally applicable app. Finally, you want to make sure that you have some sort of charts, graphs, something to make the app feel more scientific. People like to know that something that they're using has been proven to work, that other people have successfully used it. And by adding these charts and graphs, it'll make it so your app seems very legitimate. The next step is you're going to want to design your data structures. This is very important, specifically for vibe coding. It's important to know what your data is gonna look like how it's shaped because when you feed the egg AI such as Cursor or Claude. It'll make it much more simple for the AI to know what exactly you're trying to build, so it doesn't have to make any guesses on what you're trying to make. I recommend making a text document with an explanation as well as some JSON data that explains what your data actually looks like, and some information about each of the attributes that you're going to have for your data. By giving it this text document in advance, it allows me to code this thing very quickly. With this prep done, you can actually start to build the app. Usually, I'd start with building the core functionality of the app, skipping the onboarding, and just going straight for the main features of the app, you can really just drop the screenshots into Clod or Cursor, whatever AI you're using. And because it's now able to read the images and understand what it's looking at, it'll actually be able to write the code for the full screen for you. When working with AI, it doesn't always get everything right on the first time. So sometimes you need to just continue to work with it and eventually it'll get the details correct. I don't recommend being too picky because it's important to get a version out quickly rather than getting a perfect app out. As far as the tools that I use now, I honestly just use Clod. That's the only thing I'm using for AI coding and it does everything for me. It is absolutely insane that Connor was able to build and launch this app in just a few weeks. I hope that his story inspires a lot of people watching to get started and vibe code stuff as well. However, I need you to be careful. I see a lot of people get into vibe coding, try to one shot something real quick, get lost, not be able to deploy and then give up because here's the truth about building with AI. You need to know how to use these AI tools effectively what to build. how to ship fast and how to build something that actually works. Well, this is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build, which is our program where you will learn how to launch your project using only AI coding tools and do it in just a couple of weeks. Once you understand how to actually leverage these AI tools, you can build a lot faster and save a whole lot of time. So if you're ready to learn how to build apps the right way with AI, well head to the first link in the description to check out Starter Story Build. Our next cohort is starting this week. So definitely check out that link and save your spot. All right, let's get back to the video. The next question I have for you is around validation. You've built multiple apps that are really successful. And I know you've also built some stuff that wasn't successful as well. Looking back, how do you know if your app idea is validated and it's worth taking it the distance? So the way I see it is there's two different types of apps. There's innovating new ideas and there's modifying versions of existing ideas. If you're creating a modified version of an then congrats, your app is already validated by other people. Now all you have to do is make some modifications and make it so the app feels like it's your own. The other option is when you're making something brand new. What I usually do when I'm making something brand new is go look on TikTok, Instagram, see if anyone's talking about the problem that you're trying to solve. You want to make sure that there's an easy path for you to market this app by looking at the comments and seeing like are people asking questions, asking like how do I solve this problem? Then now with the current state of how fast you can build apps, I actually will skip the waitlist steps and just go ahead and build the app. I really believe that any app can make thousands of dollars these days. Your idea doesn't have to be some crazy app that changes society to make a couple thousand dollars. There's hundreds of millions of people in the US alone, and if you can even capture a tiny grain of sand out of that then you can make more than enough to sustain yourself. I agree with that too. There are so many apps out there that are crushing it. we don't even know about. It's pretty insane what's possible today. But as we know, building it is not enough. We have to focus on one very important thing, which is distribution. My next question for you is around marketing. What was your playbook to grow this app from zero to $20,000 a month in 50 days? And what is your general playbook for marketing apps? For this app, there was a couple different tactics that I used to get the app off the ground. The first one was influencer campaigns. This is when you work with an influencer and have them promote the app for their already existing audience. If you can work with an influencer and get them to promote your product, people already have some degree of trust for that influencer. And they're more likely to listen to their recommendations. For this app I partnered with a content creator that was already in the niche for the app I was building. And his videos were able to drive a bunch of traffic to the app, like thousands of downloads. The goal is to create relatable viral content about your app that comes off as natural and unprocessed. Once one of these videos starts to perform well, you can get more videos like that made with other creators. So you can have people just repeat formats that are working for you. One of the major benefits of running these UGC campaigns is that as these creators produce content, you're building out a library of ads that you can run in the future. And you already know relatively how good the performance will be on ads based on how well it did organically. And my goal is to always get my app to the point where I can run paid ads. It's the most consistent way to drive revenue growth to your app. Recently, the paid ads algorithm has changed. Facebook is trying to balance two things: They want to make sure that the advertisers are happy with their results while also keeping people on the platform by making sure the videos are entertaining. The more entertaining your video is, the cheaper it'll be to get your video put in front of people. But you also want to make sure that you're driving conversions. So your ad has to also make sure that it pushes your product. So it's important to find that balance between having a video that's very entertaining and also has the potential to convert. Thank you for sharing all those growth tactics. I think that might be... The most important part. We haven't really talked too much about what your app actually does. Would you be able to show us a quick demo of your onboarding and how your app works? So my app is called Payout. It's a class action lawsuit discovery app that lets people find class action lawsuits that they already are applicable for. And this is basically just a way for people to get some money from companies that have done something wrong. So for the onboarding, I'll quickly run through it here, asking for activity notifications. You can see the social proof. Here's the paywall. This paywall has been converting really well You can see that I have a weekly and a yearly option here, and the goal is to prioritize users to get the yearly options since it has the highest lifetime value per customer. Here's the main feature of the app: It's a list of class action lawsuits that you can check and see if you're applicable for. For example this one is the NBA Top Shot app. They had a privacy settlement over the MetaPixel being on their website. You can see the description requirements of who's applicable for this lawsuit. You press the "Get Started" button and "Fill Form", and this will take you to a form that you can fill out, put all of your information in, and have everything ready to go to mail this in and claim your class action settlement. And you can see the app will prepare the PDF ready for you to mail in. There's also the wallet tab where you can keep track of all the class action lawsuits that you're applying for and your forms tab where you can see all the forms that you've already filled out. Okay, I mean, that's a really cool idea for an app. I think anybody watching this right now probably wants to go on there and check and see if they're owed any money from these class action lawsuits. What is it about this app that really makes it work? Why do you think it did zero to 20K a month so fast? I think the value proposition for this app is just very obvious. There's some core things that all people want. They wanna be healthier, they wanna make more money, they wanna look attractive, all sorts of things like this. I like to make apps that tap into these core human desires and I think that anybody that wants to build apps should be doing the same. And this one plays into people wanna make more money. So it's very easy for people to invest money into an app that they know will make them more money. - Okay, I wanna change topics a little bit and understand how you built this app. What tech stack do you use and what tools do you use to run this business? - I use Figma for UI design apps or screenshots and making the app icon. I use Mixpanel for analytics, I use Cloud Code for vibe coding. For the more technical stuff, I'll use Next.js and TypeScript for my website and backend. I use Vercel for hosting, I use GitHub for version control as well as making it easier to host. I use Expo for cross-platform build management, and I use Revenue Cat for subscription analytics and pricing testing. Okay, cool. Thanks for sharing. That's a pretty simple stack you got there. I like that. The last question I have for you that I ask everyone who comes on to Starter Story, what advice would you have for anyone watching this that wants to build apps like you? You've built a bunch of successful stuff. You built some failed things. What would be your number one piece of advice on getting started today? My number one piece of advice would be to build something simple with a great onboarding. A simple app can make lots of money. You only really need one to three good features and your onboarding will pull most of the weight for you. All right. Well, - That's great advice. Thank you, Connor for coming on. I love what you built amazing stuff you shared here. Thanks for coming on and sharing everything. - Yeah, thanks for having me. - All right, I wanna thank Connor for coming onto the channel. I hope this video finally gives you the proof that you can build apps in a matter of weeks that grow really, really fast. This video was the playbook here on how to do it. And we're showing you the real actual app that he did it with. If you're ready to launch your app then definitely check out Starter Story Build. We will help take your idea, turn into a real app get it in front of real people using only AI tools. If you're ready to get off the sidelines and launch, head to the link in the description and check out Starter Story Build. I promise you won't regret it. All right, that's it for this episode. Thank you guys for watching. We'll see you in the next one.
