## Transcription

So my mobile app, PuffCount, is currently doing $40,000 per month in recurring revenue. I honestly don't think you need any experience to build mobile apps because to be honest, like, I didn't have any. How did this guy build a $40,000 per month mobile app with no coding experience? Well, it's all because of his unconventional approach to shipping. Marketing really is 95% of the success of a mobile app. Stephen Cravatta started his journey as a typical online entrepreneur. Jumping from one business model to another while not seeing really any success with anything. But one day he stumbled upon mobile apps and immediately recognized the opportunity. Not a lot of people are doing mobile apps right now, but it's a lot easier than a lot of people think to get into. It's untapped. So I gave Stephen a call and asked him about his business and how anyone can start building similar profitable mobile apps from scratch. Luckily, he shared his entire process. How to find and validate your idea, how to build an app with no experience, and how to market and monetize it. All right, let's get into it. I'm Pat Walls, and this is Starter Story. What's up, Stephen? It's exciting to have you. Thanks for joining the show. Can you tell me a little bit more about yourself and the business that you built? Yeah, sure. I'm Stephen Cravatta. I build viral mobile apps. I've amassed over 12 million downloads on my apps in total. I'm working on an app right now called Puff Count that is currently doing $40,000 in monthly recurring revenue. So this is the last 30 days of sales for Puff Count. As you can see we did $43,000 in sales and if we look at the last 90, we have done just over $112,000 in sales. So before we get into how people can actually start building these apps, can you tell us what you really like about this business model? With apps, there's unlimited scale. You can reach anyone on the planet and all you have to do is build it once and you could sell it a million times. So it's unlike any other business in that way. But also it's a lot easier than a lot of people think to get into with no code tools and with Upwork, you can build these apps in less than a month and there's templates online so you can start you don't have to start from scratch anymore. The biggest misconception people have is that like it's hard to get into. So like not a lot of people are doing mobile apps right now. It's untapped. But I honestly don't think you need any experience to build mobile apps because to be honest, I don't design anything. I don't develop anything. I just have the idea and I know how to put a team together. You just need to be driven and not give up on your idea. Got it. Okay, let's talk about how you can actually build something like this step by step. Everything starts with an idea, right? Can you share your ideation process? I take mental notes of problems that I experience in my day-to-day life. Building an app from the position of solving a problem for yourself, you become the ideal user. And that makes you so much better at creating the product and making it useful for the people who are trying to reach. If you can solve a problem for someone and you can kind of take them through this transformation, whether it be weight loss, dieting, quitting vaping, if you can improve someone's life, they are going to love your product. And the marketing becomes much easier as well, right? Because you can be like, Hey, you have XYZ problem. Here's the solution. So everything becomes easy if you're solving a problem for someone. Steven is the perfect example of how someone with zero experience turned a simple idea into thousands of dollars. But that came with knowing the right information and having the right problem to solve. Now, imagine there was a place that gave you all this: the problems to solve, the blueprints to solve them, and the strategies that turn simple ideas into million-dollar online businesses. Well, that's what you're going to get at Starter Story. It's a library of over 4,000 case studies and business idea breakdowns where you can access this all backed by data from real entrepreneurs. So if you're serious about building a profitable side project head to the first link in the description and we're going to give you 52 micro sass ideas just like Stevens so you can get started on your journey right now. Okay, so scratching your own itch is definitely the way to go if you want to find a painful problem. after you get the idea for your app? How do you actually validate it's an idea worth building? I did market research. I looked at Sensor Tower, looked at other quit drinking or quit smoking cigarettes apps and I saw that they were crushing it. Looked at Google Trends, saw that vaping was on the rise and then probably the most important part was I looked on TikTok. I saw that vape videos were going super viral on TikTok but I think where a lot of young entrepreneurs especially fall short is they give up on the idea too quickly. If you have a good idea and it solves a problem for people like me commit to it just like me for puff count the first four to six months i didn't make any money it was only after i locked in the marketing like marketing is 90 of being successful and validating an idea all right we'll definitely touch on the marketing later but for now let's focus on building the app what do you do after the idea is locked in what i do is i brain dump - Everything. So I get on Google Docs and I brain dump all the ideas, all the features that I want in the app. I put all the competitors there and I kind of write out what I think the app should do. And then from there, I literally take a piece of paper and a pencil and I start to sketch out the app. When you're looking at these competitors and you're seeing who's making money in your niche in the market, on the app store, you should be taking note of everything. Their features, their onboarding, their UI. That will give you a good guide into what a good app looks like. And then you take those sketches and you upload them to a site called 99designs. You upload those sketches and you say, here's the app. Here's the premise of it. Here are the features make my app come to life. And you'll have 50, 60, sometimes 70 plus professional UI designers all submit their idea of what your apps should look like. This is how I developed the UI for literally all of my apps. Okay. And what about turning that design into an actual working app? How do you build it with no coding experience? You go on to Upwork and you look for a developer. You can price it based on like the complexity of your app for an app like Puff Counts, fairly straightforward. couple main features, you get that done for less than five grand. Right? You can get the MVP out there. I recommend only hiring developers from Eastern Europe. They're going to give you the best quality code for a cheaper price. Once you have your developer that you'd like to go with, you do it on a per project completion basis. So I don't pay anyone per hour. I pay them when the app is complete. It's on the store. There's no bugs. But 100% you can build an app for less than $1,000. You can go to a website called theme forest and you can download pretty decent starter template for any app out there. And again, you know, just launching an MVP, like keep it simple. And if your budget is tighter, like the simpler your app, the better. And how do we trust the developer? What if they steal the idea for our app? It's never been a problem for me. And also your ideas are worth absolutely nothing. And more likely than not, the idea that you have for this app already exists. So like the idea is out there. You just have to trust someone. I always take like a 15 minute interview call with the people that I like from the applicants on Upwork. I get their vibe. I see, are they coming to the table with more ideas for my app? Do they seem excited about it? How do they present? But you have to get past that fear of hiring someone online that you don't really know. Like, that's part of being a founder is finding great talent, trusting them and iterating as you go. Okay, now let's talk about the elephant in the room. Marketing. Share your strategy. Marketing really is 95% of the success of a mobile app. And TikTok is the best way to market any app. The only thing you need to be successful on TikTok is marketing. you need to know how to do market research. So that's exactly what I did. I went on TikTok, I typed in vaping and I saved all of the most viral videos there and I put them into a spreadsheet so I could really understand what the hook was, what the value was, how they were shooting the content. For example, this one that got 8.3 million views drove tens of thousands of downloads for PuffCount. I saw a viral video. This guy had like 20 million plus views taking part of vape. So I was like, okay, cool. I'm going to use the same concept and I'm going to show people exactly what are in a vape. And then at the end conveniently Call to action, baby. Nothing crazy. I think where a lot of people go wrong is like they'll make the entire video about their products and they'll talk about the features and all this other stuff and then it becomes a clear sales video. Like that sucks. No one wants to watch a sales video on TikTok. My TikToks are entertainment first, call to action at the end. A quick two second call to action. Okay, so right now TikTok organic is the bread and butter of marketing mobile apps, but are there any other marketing channels that have worked well for you? The beautiful thing about organic TikTok is if the video does well organically, it's a great indicator that it's a great creative in general. You can put them on paid ads and click the spend my money button. That's literally all you have to do because as long as the creative is good, the algorithms on Facebook ads or TikTok ads or whatever, they will optimize around that solid creative and they will find you customers. What you can also do is you can find influencers on these platforms and you can pay them to make content for you. In my experience, it's tough to, you know, work with influencers. They always want a ton of cash and they don't really care, you know, how the videos perform for you. But you can find those diamond in the rough creators and you can reach out to them and get pretty cheap content and you can use that and scale that way as well. Okay, cool. Now let's talk about the next step of the process of building a mobile app: monetization. What's the best strategy to turn these users or turn these eyeballs into paying customers? Yeah, so there's many different ways to monetize apps. And my first games I monetize through ads because people were on the app all the time. They were playing the game a lot, so the ads worked well for Grid and Wordle. But for these tool focused apps like PuffCount, ads don't really work because you're not expecting the user to be on your app for a super long period of time. So the way you monetize that is through in-app purchases. You need the user to either buy your app or commit to monthly, yearly, weekly subscription. The kind of strategy that everyone is using now is the app is free You go through the onboarding and then you hit what is called a hard paywall. This is essentially a screen that asks you to pay, and if you don't pay you can't access The features in the app. A hard paywall is unskippable. When I changed PuffCount to a hard paywall and I made users commit to a free trial before they could use any features in the app, it changed my business overnight. My conversion rate shot through the roof upwards of 20-25%. Nice. And what about pricing? How can someone find the best price point for their app? I A/B tested different pricings. I started at $4, went up to $12, right? With a lot of users coming to your app, you're getting a lot of data and you're understanding which price point gives the highest LTV, the highest lifetime value. I use Superwall to do this. You can remotely configure your paywalls and you can change the price without sending apps or updates so you can do it much quicker. And Superwall will actually tell you which price point will give you the best LTV. So I just optimize for that the highest LTV price point. You mentioned earlier that before getting hit with the paywall, the user is being walked through the onboarding process. What's your experience with that? The onboarding is super important because this is an opportunity for you to walk the user through their own problems. So for example, on PuffCount my onboarding is extensive and I ask the users a lot of questions and some people say that's annoying. I don't want to do that. I just want to get into the app but the data has told me that if I walk the users through the onboarding they commit time and I'm able to walk them through their problem that PuffCount is solving so when they hit the paywall they've thought about their problem a lot and they're like wow I actually really do need to quit or I really do need this product and they're much more likely to convert. All right. Now let's get technical. What tools and software do you use to build all of these apps? The tech stack I use to build apps is pretty short. I use Upwork to find and hire developers. I use 99designs to get the UI built. I use Superwall to A-B test my paywalls. Optimizing your paywall is how you're going to make money with your app. You need to optimize your paywall and find the highest LTV, so that is 100% essential. Everyone who has a mobile app should For analytics data, Revenue Cat is good too because that will give you more data on your user lifetime value. And again, your user lifetime value is like the most important metric in your app. You need to understand how much paying users are generating you over their lifetime so that you know how much you can spend on paid ads or on influencers or on installs. And as long as your customer acquisition cost is lower than your LTV, you're making money. I use AppsFlyer as my MMP. It connects with my mobile app and Facebook or TikTok ads and sends data back to those platforms. I use TikTok and Facebook ads to send traffic. I also use Mixpanel and Amplitude to get kind of more in-depth analytics in my products and see what people are doing in the app once they do download it, once they do pay. And cheat code is like you should stay on the free plans. I don't think you should ever really upgrade Mixpanel or Amplitude. Like you should get your data, understand what you need to change and then get out. All right, for anyone looking for ideas, I wanna ask, what do you think is the most lucrative niche to build an app in right now? When I look at like the most profitable niches in mobile apps, I think a lot of them do have to do with helping people be better. Lose weight, quit vaping, quit drinking, anything in the health space I think will absolutely crush. And of course, like there are already apps that are doing really well. Like in fitness, you have like MyFitnessPal and you have all these weight training apps, but it comes down to the marketing. Can you get in front of people at a cheaper cost than these mobile apps, right? Being a young founder, you truly do have an advantage because all these old big, slow moving companies that never iterate on their idea. A small, nimble entrepreneur can take them out. All it takes is one viral TikTok. All right. Another question for you. Some people watching this right now may have started a couple other things before but didn't see immediate results and eventually gave up or quit. What advice would you give to those people? The struggle of building something new is it's never going to be perfect on the first try. But I've done this enough times now to know it's a process and you have to keep iterating. I know it's a good idea. I know it can make money. That's all I need. I don't need it to work super quick, right? Like I just need that validation. And then I can go out into the market and talk to customers and make it better over time. Everything is built over time. PuffCount has been live for four years, but only last six or seven months have I really made decent revenue per month. It takes time, it takes commitment, and you have to be willing to learn. All right, next question. How does a day in the life look like for a mobile app builder like you? I'm actually nomading. I've been traveling for about six months now. I'm in Europe time, so my day doesn't start until later in the afternoon. Like 1 p.m. is when I start hopping on the phone and talking to people. So I have my morning to myself, make a coffee, go to the gym, get a workout in, and then I'm in the zone to start building, start talking to my team, start taking sales calls, whatever it is. And I work till 7, 8, 9 p.m., sometimes much later, depending on what's getting done. And then on the weekends, I have a chance to explore an entirely new city and new culture and Meet new people and try new things. So inspiration is a fleeting feeling. And when you do feel inspired to build an app or build a new project or work super hard, like you have to take advantage of it. Going back to why I kind I've decided to be a nomad and travel. It's so I can do more of that. So when I had these moments of inspiration, I wasn't distracted by anything. I can lock in. All right. Last question that we always ask. If you could stand on young Steven's shoulders and give him some advice or advice for anyone who wants to make it in this online business world, what advice would you give? First of all, it's not as hard as you think. You just have to be driven and you have to be willing to work with people who have skill sets that you don't. Outsource what you're bad at and Build a team around you, build a team that you trust, treat your team well. And again, don't give up super early on the idea. It takes months, sometimes years for a project to take off. Relentlessly talk to users, get feedback and iterate based on data. A huge mistake that I see first time mobile app founders doing is like they're like, hey, this random idea for a feature in my app that I think I'm going to spend two months developing right before launching my MVP. Don't do that. Like go to market with something simple that you can afford, get feedback from users and then build on top of it with your team. All right, Steven, thank you so much for your time. The businesses that you've built are amazing. And thank you for coming on here and sharing it with everyone. Peace brother. Yo guys, I really hope you enjoyed the rest of the video and got some good takeaways from Steven. But I want to say something quick. At the end of the day, the point of these videos is to inspire you and show you that this is possible so that you can go start your own thing on your own. While learning is important and will give you new ideas, Action is the thing that's actually gonna move the needle forward and take you where you want to go. So research, learn, find an idea, and then go build that shit as fast as you can. If you're still feeling a little lost right now, click that first link in the description and you're going to get a free list of micro SaaS business ideas so you can get going on your side project. Much love and I'll see you guys in the next one.

## Transcription

What's good team? Welcome to another Small James Coding Tutorial where in this video we're going to be talking about my self-taught developer experience. If you're not familiar, I taught myself to code and landed a full stack remote developer job all within about the span of six months. And this was all done without any paid bootcamps or anything so totally free self-directed learning. So if that is something you're interested in then stick around for this video because I'm going to be talking about everything I learned, what the progression steps for each technology that I learned and how I learned them, what order all that kind of stuff, what the timelines for each looked like. I'll also be talking about some of the things that went well and almost more importantly some of the things I think didn't go well. Huge waste of time would definitely recommend learning from my experience and not repeating the same mistakes that I made Then after that I'll be talking about some of the greatest difficulties and challenges I encountered like... Imposter syndrome or you know getting stuck in tutorial hell because you know realistically tutorials are my friend become very dependent on them and it's totally natural that you... Lose the ability to independently create stuff so how I navigated that. And then at the end of the video I'll just run over some of the best tips that I think it's great for people to know before they get started and for along their journey to keep them going strong and land that developer job. or just learn to code if that's what you're interested in. Now, just quickly before we dive in, I wanted to let you know that I put together a website that's an all-in-one guide or roadmap that's based off my experience, everything I would recommend that you guys do. There's heaps of great stuff on there for learning everything you need to know about how to apply for jobs plus all the technology, where to learn all of it. Plus you can subscribe for the mailing list if you're interested. There's gonna be heaps of great content coming out in that too. Link for the website is in the description below, so definitely check that out if you're interested in doing something similar to what I did. And if you enjoy the video don't forget to like, sub, hit that notification bell and let's get into it. So at the beginning where it all began, the genesis of my learn to code journey was having a terrible job prior to this whole experience. Really unsatisfied so I quit that, dropped that like it was hot and decided to teach myself to code. Now the very first thing that I did, and I probably recommend this to all of you guys as well, is to reach out to some people that you know who are software engineers or have any kind of computer science role. Often they'll have great resources and it's just good to have a conversation with them. They might have some excellent recommendations or connections that could just facilitate your whole journey. I did exactly that. And one person in particular, I probably talked to four people. gave me the best resource to learn to code ever, and this is where I started and picked up my first programming language. Free Code Camp Absolutely phenomenal resource. I did their JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course. Super interactive. The way they teach the course is they break it down into all very specific modules for each morsel of knowledge that you should really know, each subtopic. They break it down, they give you a description of how it works, a little challenge, and then an interactive development environment where you can actually go ahead and code live, beat the challenge, solve the problem using JavaScript algorithms and data structures, and move on to the next topic. The problems are all at the perfect level where you will take a lot away from them. It's super engaging seeing yourself progress throughout their little certificate that they offer. And if you get stuck, they have great explanations on how to answer the question specifically. So that was the first thing I did. timeline for that for me was between two weeks to a month. It says 300 hours on the label of the certificate. That is a fat load of khaki. It did not take me nearly that long. You know, I would estimate approximately three to four hours per day of, you know, dedicating myself to working through that certificate. So that for me was step one and I would recommend exactly the same for you two to four weeks. Step two for me was learning HTML and CSS and I did that in the exact same place. Once again, Free Code Camp, they have a certificate on responsive web design and it covers an introduction to HTML and CSS. Once again you can code some pages using their development environment, do some challenges, get that certificate. And the certificates are super cool because you can embed them into your LinkedIn and it just looks like you have some kind of certificate which is better than nothing. You have some accreditation. So once again two to four weeks for the second one. Start of my programming was probably a month and I had JavaScript. HTML and CSS under my belt. Now this is an excellent starting point because 90% of the web essentially boils down to JavaScript, HTML and CSS and so I definitely recommend you start in the same place plus the feeling of accomplishment of learning JavaScript and actually knowing a programming language for me was monumental and really just getting the ball rolling giving me some motivation, some self confidence to just progress and keep going. So after I'd done these two things, the next thing I moved onto was a YouTube tutorial by none other Then the CSS king Kevin Powell, he had a two-hour YouTube tutorial on building a beginner portfolio website. It was the perfect progression because I kind of looked at how individual elements of HTML/CSS worked and this portfolio just pulled it all together into a website. Pretty static information taught me how to host it live and I could send it to my family and friends and You know, I was so stoked that it actually made a website for me. Once again, it was just great for giving me some encouragement and obviously his design in the tutorial looked dope. So that was cool too. Link for that will be in the description down below. I'd recommend giving that a shot too because a portfolio is a great way to start putting yourself forward to prospective employers. Hound them with your job applications. point I was kind of at a position where I had the audacity to think that I could start applying for jobs. That was pretty stupid and a quick learning curve for me, but it also helped me realize that you know I had no credibility except for those two little certificates and when you're up against a huge pool of software engineers It's just not gonna pan out well for you unless you can find a way to give yourself credibility to the employer. Without that formal education it's just hard for them to really gain enough trust to bring you on board and Just from you being like, "Oh, I completed this little certificate. You should give me a job now." So, credibility is a massive keyword to landing your first job and this was the next phase of my journey which was, you know, how do I gain this credibility? So for me, the solution was projects in my portfolio. If you can have a project that you can, you know, show to an employer and, you know, let them see the code in your GitHub, for example, it's a huge step in them being like, "Oh, this person can actually walk the talk, do what we need to do." And when you apply for their job descriptions, it will be blatantly obvious that this person literally has the skills needed to do the job. So I started off and spread myself super thin, had a whole lot of random little projects that were just maybe a bit of a waste of time. And this is probably the first learning curve. I really think you want to focus on three pieces of code, three projects that are super tidy and consistent. Ideally across all three projects you'll be able to demonstrate a wide array of skills. I'll get into more of that later and how you could potentially break that down, but for me my first project and what I thought was the natural progression of HTML CSS and JavaScript was to learn React Native not react react native for those unfamiliar react native is just the mobile app development framework that allows you to develop hybrid platform code It's very similar to React, it's just specifically for mobile development. Looking back, I was really motivated, I really wanted to build apps at the start and so for me, you know, that was why I went with React Native when 99% of people would just go with React for web development. I think for me it worked because as I said I was motivated by developing apps at that particular time and you really want to just follow the path that you have the most motivation for especially when you're self-taught However, in terms of a more natural learning progression and the one that will probably make you more employable is just picking up React. And then if you enjoy mobile development moving into React Native later. Either way they teach you a lot of the same skills. You know, they're very similar frameworks so, you know, you pick up React one way or another. And this is a huge check on your resume for employers. React is used absolutely everywhere. Totally mind-boggling as much as there are Frontend JavaScript frameworks that are more up and coming. React is the absolute top dog, and I think it is the next essential for you to learn that I learned to add to your tool belt. So I built a mobile app This was my first project that I actually finished that wasn't spread too thin that I added to my portfolio Once again, the code was on GitHub so employers could see it and the project was live so that I could give a demonstration of how it worked to anybody. This I think is a requirement as well for any of you watching on Definitely your code has to be visible on github so that they can see like the caliber of your coding capabilities and also if the project Is life it shows that you have skills like deployment and hosting and all that kind of stuff which is critical So this whole experience probably took me about another three weeks to build this app and learn react native. I followed a catamines tutorials to learn react native this for me was a real double-edged sword because at this point I Everything I developed had been based off YouTube tutorials and this is when I started to fall into tutorial hell And it's also when I had the challenge of you know, navigating that experience which I will get to shortly But yeah as I mentioned after this three weeks of learning react native You know I'm probably coming up to about two months two and a half months of development time and then it was time for me to move Into a new area of interest which was my second project and that was an e-commerce store So, as I mentioned, 90% of you will go down the React, then React Native route. I went React Native for my mobile app and then built an e-commerce store with React and Stripe. Now, I think this is also an excellent project and it's a good demonstration of skill because, you know, a majority of SaaS companies out there that could potentially, you know, their prospective employers will incorporate Stripe to handle their billing and subscription services. So being able to add Stripe to your tool belt and you know really just flex that to anybody is a great thing to have put it on your cv an e-commerce store was kind of cool for me because i think that you know e-commerce is absolutely huge everywhere it's very relevant it's a great thing you know it's a cool buzzword we definitely recommend doing something similar i decided to sell some t-shirts so i actually went ahead and printed a whole lot of t-shirts total flop because you know while i can build an e-commerce store i have no marketing skills so that was a swift learning curve But nevertheless, I built an e-commerce store, stylized it myself. However, it's important to note that once again this was just based off another YouTube tutorial except this time I adapted. And once again, this is kind of like how I learned to navigate tutorial hell is you know the keyword is adaptations. So I took the skeleton of the project that I'd done on YouTube totally gutted all the non-essentials specifically the designs, some of the basic functionality and componentry Kept all the essentials like the way Stripe was integrated in and the database systems and whatnot. And then I adapted the project to my own e-commerce store, hosted that live, put it in my portfolio, and you know, Bob's your uncle. Tried to get my mom to buy all my t-shirts. Anyway at this point, you know, that was another three weeks or so, so we're probably coming up to two and a half months, three months. And I had two projects in my portfolio that were both live. I could demonstrate the code on GitHub, you know, really flex on my coding skills. I thought I was the king of the world. Kinda navigated tutorial hell a little bit using adaptations, keyword adaptations. I'll speak to this shortly. And then at this point I felt confident enough to just litter the world with my job applications left right and center. And that experience was real gut buster for me because I still wasn't getting enough attention. You know the solution for me was to just realize that job applications are a numbers game. You know at this point I'd just really been going for front-end roles because you know all my projects were front-end projects. They were just very visual client side all that good stuff. I really needed to incorporate some backend knowledge into my tool belt so that I could just, you know, go for full stack and backend roles as well. And for me, this started off with Node.js. Absolutely love Node.js. If you're looking for a backend web server framework to pick up, you know, you already know JavaScript. Look no further. Node.js and Express. Beautiful. Great tutorial on my channel. Check that out if you are looking to get into that. Anyway, so I picked up Node.js and this gave me some experience with client-server interactions. And then after a little while, I felt confident enough to go for a full stack project. So up until this point, I'd kind of had a project that was a React Native app. I had another project that was an eCommerce store that used Stripe for billing. It used CommerceJS. Consumed that as an API inside of a React project for an eCommerce store. So, you know, you can see the pool of technology that I can advertise growing. And then for the third project, I wanted to hit home with full stack client side authentication database system, you know, whole shebang. So it was a planner app that people could log into authenticate and then, you know, create their own planners that they could access on their mobile and then on their desktop later. And all of the information is shared between them. For this I actually didn't continue with Node.js, I felt like Node.js taught me the essentials but I actually went with a PaaS service so Platform as a Service. These are phenomenal. I went with Firebase. Firebase is just absolute game changer for you know having a full stack project without having to go through a lot of the admin of hosting your back-end systems, hosting a database you know making sure that all of your systems are authorized and secure. There's quite a large learning curve there that you don't have to navigate if you just choose to use firebase as an alternative and you still get the you know ability to flex full stack development on your resume which is absolutely dope So, finished this project. This one was my biggest project yet. This took me a month and all this month I was still sending out job applications. Now as soon as I had this project in my portfolio, I had my three neat projects critical, three main projects. Any more is too much attention to spread. The attention becomes spread too thin. No one can really appreciate the thought and effort that's gone into each individual one. And the code for each of them was pinned on my GitHub and you know... just to show the effort that went into all of them, how the systems were configured and to demonstrate that I could write clean code. Once again, the benefit of doing these free CodeCamp certificates at the very start was that a lot of my code was best practice. So that was absolutely amazing. And after I submitted this project, this is when I really started to get some attention from employers, get some responses, stuff like that. And then as soon as you're getting these interviews, that is it. Then it's just a matter of time until you find the job that fits for you. Anyway, so just to quickly summarize the end of my coding journey. Learning to code probably four to five months till I was feeling pretty comfortable with full stack development. Maybe not so much the backend stuff. I could just use Firebase services and had a pretty good understanding of network requests, basic CRUD functionalities and full stack apps. And I think that's where you should really just be able to transition from learning to code to landing a job. So at this point I was sending out probably three job applications per day and all the while still trying to grow my skill tool belt. Specifically for me that meant learning Python. So for learning Python, since I'd done the free CodeCamp program, I just did a, you know, I think it was like a five hour data science tutorial on YouTube. And by the end of it, just five hours, it's sufficiently a close relative to JavaScript as far as programming languages go to, you know, be able to incorporate it into your resume, say that you're Cool and Python and all of a sudden the job pool is even bigger, you know You can start applying for jobs that use Python as a back-end service because a lot of these Python and JavaScript back-end services are very similar You know, they mirror each other in a lot of ways I'd absolutely recommend that as a progression if you're not getting the attention to your responses that you need But also this is where I made some critical learnings This is you know a real secret nugget and I think that if At this point you can say that you can code, you have the credibility. Now it's just about nailing your job applications. So for me and job applications, the secret was to have a cover letter that was sufficiently specific to the type of tech roles that I was going for which was React, Node, Fullstack, Frontend anything like that. And then I had a resume that was just very consistent. So I would for every job application adapt my cover letter very slightly, the resume would stay the same and and I'd pump out three applications per day. As for the platforms that I was applying on, there was LinkedIn, there was AngelList, and there was like the standard job board that everyone goes to in the area. Obviously everyone is familiar with LinkedIn but the volume of applicants was just mad, like you know the jobs I would go for would have 200 applicants. Where I had a lot of success was on the more niche job boards such as AngelList where it's like startups posting for new roles And the critical thing that I did, that I had a lot of positive feedback from, was every time I posted a job, I didn't do this initially, this was something I tried later. And on LinkedIn, I would find someone, either the job poster for the role or someone senior inside of the tech portion of the company. And I would slide into the LinkedIn DMs with a connection request and a small note that said, Hi, hope you're having a great week or whatever friendly introductory message. I hope this message finds you well. And then I would say, "I just noticed that you guys are posting for a React developer." You know, I myself am a seasoned React developer. They don't have to know that you just learned it. And then, you know, I would just say, "I would love to connect and maybe chat more about this role if... you know..." And, you know, sometimes they won't get back to you. Once again, if you want to really see the whole job application process, check out my roadmap website in the description. There's a really great article that I wrote about applying for jobs has all this information. But yeah, taking the initiative to send these follow-up messages and connection requests just gave me a bunch of free interviews. I didn't have to wait for responses to come back to me with some silly coding test or whatever. On a number of applications, I would get direct responses from the hiring managers who would be like, yep, absolutely. Let's have a chat. We'd set up a 20-minute call. And it literally is a free interview. And that goes so far because you get a bit of a chance to demonstrate your skills. It's so much more personable You become so much more than just another resume and if they like your personality, you know, it can be a job It's as simple as that I have One experience where the guy responded being like, I love the initiative. Absolutely. Let's have a call. Had a chat with him. He was like, yup. Excellent. Sick. Fat. Love it. Let's set up a call with the rest of the team. Talk to the rest of the team. And you know, lo and behold, there's an offer just from taking the initiative. No one else. None of the hundred applicants that applied for that job took the initiative to message the geezer on LinkedIn slide into the DMS with a friendly approach. And there's your, there's your job offer. And this, so that is essential. You have to do that. If you're not doing that big oopsie, I really recommend doing that. The other thing that landed me the job that I currently have, you know, once again it's a numbers game. I didn't necessarily proceed with this offer because it wasn't quite the tech that I was looking to work with. You know, for some reason I had the confidence to be a bit more patient. The thing that actually landed me the job that I have today was my communication. Now, you know, what is communication? Communication is not how well you speak a particular language, it's the intention behind your messages. So for me I had this great job that I was looking at and I actually got rejected in the first instance because I applied late and they had already filled the role by the time that I was applying. However they still took me through the first phase of the interview so I had a chance to demonstrate my communication skills. What that looked like for me was just consistent, considerate, kind messages. You know, they gave me an initial interview. I'm sure you don't know what's going on. As soon as the interview ended, I just said, "I'm so thankful for the opportunity. Love meeting you guys. It was interesting hearing about everything that you're working on. Look forward to hearing from you." Never putting any pressure on them to proceed with you but always showing gratitude for the opportunity to get to meet them, get to learn from them and get to understand more about their company and what they do. So, you know in this particular role that I have currently I got a second interview with a bit more of the team Once again, the same thing just you know kind response after the interview following up always sending that positive reinforcing message That's just like no stress Loved meeting you guys. Just this opportunity is excellent Lots of gratitude and then got rejected because the role was full even in that rejection and this is a huge thing, you know No you get rejected 90% of the applicants for these roles are just like, oh next one move on. I followed up. I said, you know, no worries totally understand all good once again so grateful for this opportunity. Week later or something like that the guy responds to me he's like love the way you communicate we're gonna see if we can work something out and bring you in. That was my job great tech stack phenomenal role couldn't have asked for a better opportunity so thankful that You know, they gave me this chance because it's been an excellent team to work with. And I just couldn't be happier because of the communication skills. You reach a point where everyone can code. You know, as I mentioned you've displayed your credibility. You can match all these other plebeians that have done the software engineering qualifications or whatever in terms of their ability to code a full stack application. Now it's about demonstrating that you are going to fit in the team. You can communicate, you're friendly, you smile. You know, and they want you in their team and that's what's really going to land you the role. Make sure you send kind messages and never feel afraid of bombarding people with happy smiley face emojis because it's the positivity that the world needs. So as I mentioned this whole discourse took about six months from learning to code. I'd say it was four months of really spending time actually learning to fill code and feel comfortable behind my keyboard. two months was just grinding job applications. And every time I got a rejection, I would improve something about my application, whether or not it was just making my portfolio look a bit tidier, changing some of the messaging, updating a GitHub read me, whatever, you know, just doing something a little bit better and improving myself until I landed these roles. And so now we're at a part of the video where I'm just quickly gonna speak to the big challenges that I encountered. So the first one is tutorial hell. This is absolutely a problem for, you know, learner developers. I myself have a code in YouTube, as you may have seen. Check out some of the videos, but don't fall into tutorial hell. Super easy fix that, you know, it took me way too long to learn was adaptations. You start off following a tutorial and the first tutorial that you do to build a project, don't leave it that way. Change something. Change a font size. Change a text color. Change a background color. Do a different image. Resize the image. Minor changes. Very small changes. accumulate into big change, a new project. It's like the ship analogy. If you buy a ship and replace every piece of the ship is it still the original ship? In coding it's absolutely not, it's your own project. For even now, I will find a tutorial that I really love, write the code out for it, save it to my github and then When I do something different, I know that I don't have to completely rebuild a lot of the skeleton frameworks to make that project work. I can just go to that GitHub repository, see how they've done the auth database, you know full stack infrastructure, copy that in and then gut the project, repurpose it, restyle it, change the functionalities, keep the barebones crud auth database system and move forward. Now the caveat to that is that it's important you understand how it works but you don't have to memorize it. And by the time you've done that three or four times, then you can just go ahead and write it whenever you want. Adaptations. On the first project change something minor, on the fifth project, the fifth tutorial you go through, you know, change the whole functionality. Take a to-do crud app and turn it into a calendar planner, whatever you like. Solution to tutorial hell right there. The second one I struggled with is imposter syndrome. As a developer, so many applicants, it's just mad. You will suffer a fair amount of rejection and especially after months and months of effort, it can just be super draining and tiresome and demotivating, demoralizing all of these negative words. You have to be dumb, dumb enough to have unreasonable amounts of self-confidence and also you just have to realize that a rejection is not what a rejection actually seems like. There is such a high volume of candidates nowadays that rejection is just I guarantee you'll get a lot of it. You just have to be stupid enough to ignore all of it, have unreasonable amounts of self-confidence and remember that it's actually these people who are the Muppets who are missing out on the great opportunity to work with you. It's not an actual rejection. It's just that they can't see more than just a resume. They don't really get an opportunity to see who you are. It's just a rejection because they don't have the attention to detail that they really need to appreciate a candidate like yourself. The other thing I'd recommend is... you just a really important thing to demonstrate is you want to be the best learner. There's going to be two types of people some people will get critique or criticism and really just respond negatively, and as a junior developer that is just a massive red flag. You want to make sure that every time you receive feedback rejection any kind of criticism ideally it would be constructive you want to take on board be grateful that you've had the opportunity to learn and you know improve if you can demonstrate that skill set in addition to having good communication then even the best developer will not stack up against you because as soon as you all reach a certain level of coding, any amount above doesn't really matter. You really just want to be the person that can complement that ability of coding with some good soft skills which is being a good learner, receptive to feedback and an excellent communicator. But once again, rejection, you're going to get a lot of it. It's just a numbers game. You just have to send out the applications, get them done, improve a tiny bit each time And it's just a matter of time before you will land a job. Stupid levels of self-confidence That's what makes the world go round, you just gotta join the club. Now those are the big challenges, glad we've capped that. Onto the tips and tricks I would just absolutely essential from my point of view to give to you that you should know before you start your coding journey and for along the way. The first one is LinkedIn. Great platform. You know, I personally don't think you need to be one of those cringe people that post their whole journey all the time If that's you, no hard feelings. It's just not me and I don't think it's necessary. What you do want to do is have a tidy profile that when you reach out to people they look at you and they're like "oh cool" And what that is is a little bit of self-expression in terms of the banner. You know you want to have a nice and tidy profile image and you also want to have your desired role in your subheader. And then in your description you want your previous experience filled out It doesn't matter if it's related to tech or not, there's always a positive takeaway in terms of like problem solving communication leadership. And just turn it into something that will constructively help your tech applications. You know, if you solved any form of problem, had any kind of communication issues, led a team, that's all great project management. It can all be turned into a benefit. As I mentioned earlier, add your certificates from Free Code Camp if you have them and also LinkedIn has some skill certifications. You can get little badges for them. If you can get them they look good because it will just prioritize you when recruiters go looking for, you know People who can code in HTML. The second one is github absolutely essential I got my github too late and I didn't contribute or commit to it enough If you don't know how it works or how git works check out the git crash course on my youtube page It's pretty quick. It should teach you what you need to know then set up a github account and And from the minute that you've finished your free CodeCamp certificates for web design and JavaScript, and you're coding your own projects in Visual Studio Code Editor, commit daily. Employers will look at your GitHub and check your activity bar as a measure of your commitment and drive to it. to learn to code, self-improve and all that kind of stuff. And if you have like six months of everyday commits, it doesn't matter if it's like a single comment added or a whole body of code as long as there's some contribution, it's all green. That's just going to be a massive green flag for employers. So definitely get on that from day one. It's a real waste if you start halfway through because you're missing out on showing that you've actually been working hard for twice as long as you have been. Another thing that I kind of spoke to earlier that I'm just really going to emphasize is don't spread yourself too thin. You really you might have a hundred ideas, you might only have one. Three is the golden number. Three plans and then what you do is you focus on learning to code, then you build a portfolio, then you populate that portfolio with your three projects. Now these three projects it's essential that each of them has a link to the live project where someone can go and check it out or try it. See that it works and then also a link to the GitHub. And this is the fourth tip: every project in your GitHub, specifically the pinned ones, three, you can have up to six I'd recommend three, they need, the code needs to be immaculate and you have to have a readme.md file for each of them that works through a logical, you know, text based description of what the project is. What the problem was, the solution you've engineered, challenges you encountered. Why it benefits society, different technologies and learnings that you've had from it. Just everything into your README that really just shows that you can break down a problem, we've got problem solving skills, you learn, you can tackle challenges and you can write good code. Super important to have these extra special READMES just so that someone doesn't have to sift through all the code to understand what's going on. You know, you can talk about the common features, the tech stack, all that kind of good stuff. Really good to have if you're demonstrating your projects. The next one is about cataloging information as you go along your journey. Every good resource, YouTube tutorial, you know maybe it's an article, it's a GitHub repository, everything like that that you come across, you really just want to catalog it into, you know, it could be your own GitHub repository if you've rewritten the code from a YouTube tutorial, it could be writing a Medium article and setting up a Medium account that just is like oh you learn how to set up a Python environment using the virtual env package and it was really concise write a guide on it, make it even more concise and just build a library of these amazing things that you can't quite remember, but you know you're going to want to access or index at some other point in the future. So good, I have one particular modal tutorial that I love for building modals in React. I can't always remember how to do it off the top of my head because it's fairly infrequent, but I know that I can just go to my GitHub, see how it's done, remember everything that's happened in two seconds And it's just great to have a catalog of all these things that I know I can lean on even though they're not in like my instant recall. I understand how they work and I have them there when I need them. And this leads me into the last thing which is the best way to learn and memorize code. Now, I don't think you should memorize code but there's ways that you can go about coding that will make it stick better. And for me the critical part is whenever you do a tutorial comment it throughout. Write out their code. But each time like you do a function and you learn what the function does, leave a comment above the function that just speaks to it. It's tenfold a good thing to do because it means that for one you spend more time understanding all the different steps that happen. You know like maybe I passed this reference value here for this reason. Just comments all throughout for your own benefit absolutely improves the learning process, consolidates that information in your head and you will just be able to access it better. And the second fold reason is that it makes it a million times easier if you're coming back to it after a period of time. You don't want to have to go watch the whole two hour tutorial, but maybe you just want to be able to look at one particular file. You can see you've left all these nice little notes to yourself to really explain what's going on. And as you review that code to reuse it, it's just very explicit and clear what that does and it's right there for you. Great for learning to code in terms of just making sure it's a really efficient process for you. And that's pretty much it really, that's the whole story. You know six month turnaround, learned some front-end stuff, some back-end stuff, landed a full stack remote developer job. Thank you so much for watching. If you want to give this a shot, that's what I've set my whole YouTube up around.

# How To Build A $10,000 Website In 30 Minutes (AI + No Code)

**Date**: 2026-01-18
**URL**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEjwCUcMHo

## Transcription

- This website, this website, and this website were all built without writing a single line of code. But what if I told you that you could build your own $10,000 websites in just 30 minutes? And to prove it to you, I'm gonna show you exactly how you can use these three no-code and AI tools to launch your own websites from scratch. But first of all, what's a $10,000 website? What does that actually mean? Well, to answer that question, I've decided to simply ask AI. So I'm gonna go to Claude and we're gonna ask it what it thinks is included in a $10,000 website. So I'm gonna jump in here and just ask, What features would you include if I'm building a $10,000 website for a client? So it's telling me to focus on essential business driving features rather than fancy extras. It talks about performance and security. It talks about CMS and mobile responsiveness, meaning they look good on a phone as well as a tablet, as well as a browser. It's also made a much more comprehensive list that I'll be going through throughout this video. And I'm definitely going to want to include some beautiful design, potentially some animations so that this can really pop. So we have a pretty good idea of what kind of features we'll have to build, but what what kind of website are we actually gonna be building? Okay, so for this challenge I've decided I'm gonna be building a basketball manufacturing company. We're gonna call it Hoops. And the two main goals of this website are going to be to elevate the brand but also to get retailers to contact us to order large quantities of basketballs. But now before we jump in I wanna get a little bit of inspiration from websites so I can determine what the color palette is, what the overall kind of aesthetic is gonna look like And then we're gonna jump into the build. So I'm gonna jump in and find some inspiration for my website. So here I've come to Webflow, 'cause it's one of the website builders I really like. And I'm gonna go and check out some of the templates. I found something that I find pretty cool. First of all, I like dark mode, so I think I'm gonna go for something like this, with kind of like a pink, and then maybe like a blue as well. And so yeah, my website will not look like this, but this can be pretty inspiring for design purposes. Now that we found some inspiration, let's jump in and start building. Now the main tool we're gonna use to build this whole website out is called And the way I'm gonna start building this out is simply by having a very simple landing page. And then I'm gonna build out additional pages on top of that. I'm gonna start off with a simple prompt. So here, I'm simply gonna put, "Please build a simple landing page for a basketball manufacturing company. Keep the design very basic." And then what I can do here is enhance this with AI. And then I'm just gonna go ahead and click Go. Okay, so the first thing it runs into is a problem. No problem, let's fix this problem. Okay, so I don't see anything in the preview, so I'm gonna go ahead and say that. Okay, so I see a first version of what this looks like. It's not what I'm looking for. Definitely not the color palette we were talking about. I see there's some bugs too, but hey, it's a start. So this is the next thing I'm gonna do. I'm basically going to figure out what are the different things I wanna have inside of this? So first let's talk about what we actually wanna have in this homepage. Now, I think that the hero is pretty cool. Could you add a section below the hero about the technology of the balls. Now it's added that, but I do see that there is this extra little thing here, so I'm not super happy with that. Please take away this innovation in every detail overlay. So now it's taken that away and we can see that underneath it's also added a really beautiful picture of a guy dunking. The next step here is going to be to add additional sections here for the homepage, and then we're basically going to adapt it to the color palette and the kind of styling of the website that I showed you earlier. Please take the section... And notice that I'm only prompting it step by step. I don't want it to do too many things at the same time. Now we see that it's taken that section out. Next step, I'm gonna be working a little bit on this, perfect this landing page first with a couple additional prompts. And then I'll show you what I've done for the landing page in just a second and we'll be able to move on to the next step. So now we've created the structure and it's time to make this website more beautiful. And we're gonna keep the exciting stuff like animations for the end of this video, but it's time to turn this landing page into a more beautiful website because we're gonna need it. So I've done a first version here of the layout and we basically just have the hero section Then we go into the ball technology section. Then we're gonna hop into kind of a bit of the history over here. Then we're gonna jump into the actual showcasing, a couple of the ball technologies or the collection, let's call it. And then finally, we have a call to action. So this homepage is pretty much the structure of it is done. But now I wanna start adapting a little bit to the style that I want. Can you make all the sections in dark mode like the technology section? Let's see what it looks like advanced ball technology. technology. Okay, cool. This is already looking a little bit cleaner and now I don't really like this orange to be honest, I think I'm going to go for the color that we had in the other one which is kind of a purple pink actually what I like doing for this is I can just do a screenshot of this I can go to a place like image to hex color I'm just going to grab this color over here. I did that by just coming here uploading that little image grab this hex code over here. And then I'm going to go inside a bolt until it make the buttons this color okay and now it's actually changed that you can even see that it's changed the logo here also change these images so i'm starting to like this a little bit more also use it for the logo in the footer now we go to the footer and boom it has been updated now this next design trick i think you're gonna love it so you see how this nav looks pretty good i actually want it to be a bit more transparent i want it to have a more modern look and if i come back From here, I can see a pretty good example of how that's done here. So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go ahead and screenshot this. I'm gonna upload it here and just say, "I would like my nav bar to look like this image." Now it's kind of made a gradient here as you can see, but it hasn't made it circular and floating. So let me see if I can actually adapt that. And I don't actually know how to describe this. So what I'm going to do next is I'm going to be going to Claude. I'm going to upload the image of the actual nav. describe this navigation bar as if you were a designer. So it seems like it's called floating navigation. So I'm going to basically reference floating navigation and I'm going to tell it that I want this around it container you make a navigation a floated navigation and then with within a rounded container, don't change the rest. Let's see what it comes up with. And we will find some limitations to this method but I have found that you can actually do pretty impressive stuff here. This is looking stylish. I'm really liking this. I'm actually going to ask it if it can have completely rounded edges, even more rounded and make the outline slightly thicker. I'm trying to get this first page to look kind of the way I want it to, because when I create these additional pages, it'll just respect the similar design elements and hopefully we won't have to change too much from there. Could you make the floating nav more transparent? Boom That looks pretty clean, doesn't it? When you like kind of scroll over, you can see that transparent background. That just looks very classy to me. But there are still some changes that I want to apply. And let's start with this advanced ball technology section. I want this to look so clean. I want to have a little background as well. So I'm going to ask for it to be described to me this specific grid by again grabbing a screenshot of this, bringing it into cloud and uploading it and asking for it to describe that to me. For the technology section, could you please give the background a sophisticated grid? and have a deep purple blur behind the cards. Boom, just looks so beautiful. And now what I'm gonna do here is that I'm gonna ask for it to do something kind of similar but maybe in blue for the section below. I like the fact that we're kinda similar to this color so let me go ahead and find out which color that is and then I'm gonna go ahead and add. It looks a little different than that obviously but it still looks cool. Now for this next section, it's like it's quite classy, but what I'd like to do is add a extra little touch here. So let me go ahead and see what I can use. Maybe find another kind of element that I find pretty from this specific design. So I'm gonna say something like, okay, for the section called a legacy of excellence, could you please add a blue Blur, use a similar tone of blue as found in the image. Okay, this is starting to come together, I'm liking it. However, let's change the logo. I like the logo to look a little more tech forward and be hoops. Let's see what it gives us. I didn't want it to be like that but I think this is really good. It's like hey, we're a ball making company. We have the most advanced tech for this. I love what I did here with the background So I'm going to tell it to apply the same background for the professional series. And now starting to see some inconsistencies, but we're going to polish those off in just a little second and I'm taking a good amount of time here on the design because I believe that a $10,000 website is really something that looks beautiful. So let's go ahead and focus on that for just a little bit. I'm taking a good amount of time doing this, but I know it's gonna be worth it. So here I'm asking you to have the same shape of, I wanted to make all of the buttons now circular. because it seems like that's kind of the style i'm going for i'm not actually making these fancy buttons but i'm going to start finishing off at least the initial design then we're going to move on to the next step so let's do this now this is what we were looking for the buttons now are circular now what i'm going to do is i'm going to determine the pages that i actually want to have now please for the nav add these sections blog products about us and take out the We're not actually gonna make this an e-commerce website. We're actually gonna take out the shopping element of it. It seems like I took away the card, but it didn't change anything else. Okay, could you add in the nav a section called product? Now we got them right here, products about us and blog. I think that's pretty much all I'm going to keep for the nav. I want it to stay relatively simple here. And the next step for us is going to be to actually create pages behind each one of these additional ones. And then we can come in and start perfecting, please create pages behind each navigation section using the same design as the home. Mama Mia, look at this looks great about us our story. So there's not really much of a story. Right here, but then there's the years of experience, all of that. Our leadership team can adapt any one of these things by the way for sure. And then the blog itself is going to be a collection of blog posts perfect with that beautiful design behind it as well. It's starting to really all come together. I'm super stoked. Quick reality check. Now we've created the homepage. We've created a little bit of designer on that. We've also been able to create additional pages. But one of the next important things is gonna be to create a CMS which is a content management system. And we're actually going to implement that for the blog, meaning that someone would be able to just log in, create a new blog post, and that it would automatically update on the website. So we're going to create a simple version of this, and then we're going to have an admin panel to be able to control that. And I have a beautiful cherry on top that's prepared for the end of this video, so make sure to stick around. By the way, if you have an app idea and you'd like to work with our team, we've just opened up a couple of spots for our one-on-one coaching program. that helps you not only identify exactly what you should build as a first step, then build it out leveraging no code and AI tools, and will guide you on how to get first paying customers for it too. We've now trained more than 600 entrepreneurs, founders like Heidi, who came to us with some great domain knowledge but didn't unfortunately have any technical skills and didn't know how to get started. In just eight weeks she was able to build her first app and get $25,000 a month in recurring revenue. And now she's raised more than three million dollars from Investor for her company AwareHealth and is generating over a million dollars a year. So let's get started. Don't leave it up to luck. There is some method to this madness, and if you'd like to work with us, you can apply below. Now let's get back to this video. So for the CMS, let's go over the blog section. Click on Blog over here. See that there are already articles here. If I click on each one of these articles, it should lead me to the actual page where the articles are written. In this case, I don't have that yet, so that's the next thing I'm gonna do. Please create a CMS with dynamic routing for the blog page. Now what dynamic routing means is that if you click on this specific article, it's gonna bring you to that specific article And for each one of these articles, I'm going to want it to bring it to a different page. And that's what dynamic routing really is. So it's cooking here. It's creating, it's updating the pages. Okay. So it seems like we've run into a problem here. Now, one thing I do want to mention about running into problems is that if you do have a problem, you can always go to the last version of your product. I can always roll back to this checkpoint and this is super valuable in case something breaks in your project. Let's go ahead and try to just fix this problem. So let's see what that looks like here. I'm gonna go to the blog. I'm gonna go ahead and load. learn more about one of these blogs going to pop up. So here we're going to have the name of the person who's written this and their position, we're going to have the full blog post. It seems like it's just created a very simple one with some dummy data. Also, I can ask for there to be image behind this if I want to. In this case, I think it looks kind of clean like that. So I might just ask it to have a little less space on the top. So this really seems perfect for what I'm looking for. And I think that It even added that beautiful little gradient in the background. So I think I'm good here But I'm now gonna ask it for to create an admin section where I can just add these articles I'm gonna ask it could you add an admin section where I can add blog post now? Let's check this out Okay, cool so we can add a title here a category if you want an image URL and author name and Here I can pretty much fill everything out and I can also come here and I can delete Anyone that I want and that was just with our One prompt it was able to create all of that so we finished that CMS and now the value of our website has dramatically gone Up however, we need to reach ten thousand dollars in value And one of the best ways to do that is through animation and I'm gonna start off with classy scroll animations And then we're gonna go on to the cherry on top. This might be my favorite part of it It's the animations because it makes things look so beautiful and I kept this for one of the last parts just because it's exciting to me Can you create a beautiful loading screen with a technology background? Which is the technology section and pretty animation and with the same pink purple as a button so let's see what it comes up with go ahead and make that loading screen one second longer because it was so quick that I wasn't even able to do it okay I kinda like that so now let's have some clean and basic animation on this on this home page as well. And I'm not gonna waste too much of your time here but what I'm gonna do is ask for a bunch of smaller animations and I'll show you the result in just a minute. So I finished the animations. I'm pretty happy with them. Let's check it out. Basically, I'm going to just reload as you can see here. I have a loading screen so this basically allows the website to load and then we have Them come in with a simple animation, which is kind of fun as you scroll down on this You're going to see the cards appear with a light animation So this is to keep it really classy and then I have a different animation. I also made this actually um As you can see, it's glowing, actively glowing here, which is another animation. Here we have another section that appears with light animation and this call to action I want to call attention to it so I'm making it with a nice little glow as well. I chose to keep the other sections relatively simple as well so the about section is basically pretty simple, not too much Much animation here, but here in the journey. I have the journey appear with some animation as well I really like this one then the product section very simple as well We basically have more details about the products that we already feature on the home page and if people click on the buy now Or contact us it's gonna lead them to a place where they can find our details Let's see what that looks like also very simple clean nice design if you click on them You're gonna see that it creates an outline so if All really just trying to look classy. And then if we click on the blog, this is a blog that we've created. Looks like the images are taking a little bit of time to load. But nevertheless, I also have little animations here where if you hover over one, it will basically light up a little bit. If you click on one of these, you're going to have a nice design on this too. And so as you can see, very simple, not too many animations. But this is really the next step. Okay, it looks beautiful. And now we are basically 90% there. But I have a very special last little touch to make this thing just pop. And once we've implemented that, we're going to be able to attach it to a domain, connect it and deploy it. And the name of my secret weapons, my friends is 3D animation. So for this, we're going to be using an amazing tool that allows us to either create these 3D animations from scratch or to use preexisting ones and incorporate them to our projects to make them look like a million bucks. Let's check it out. This, my friends, is Spline. And I'm going to use a 3D design that's already been created to add it to this website. And to do that, I'm gonna go to the community tab up here. I'm gonna go ahead and search. We're gonna put basketball. Ooh Look at that little animation. Where should we put this? I think we can actually put this as the background image of my hero section. So now let's go ahead and integrate that. If I come here, what you want to do, and there is a paid plan here, you wanna go here and remix. So I'm basically gonna click on remix and grab that. And here I will literally not touch anything. This has already been created. And again, there are lots that you can find in the community and also that they've created themselves. I could choose to adapt anything about this ball, about the animation itself. I can also press play to see how it actually works. As you can see here, it just bounces around. Man, this looks amazing. I can adapt the way that it bounces too. But if I'm ready to export it, I can go ahead and click on export. Then I can just grab this link here and I can go to Bolt and be like, please make this spline animation. the background of my home hero and if this works this will be the cherry on top i think that these animations can just be so powerful oh my god it actually worked i think there's a blur here in front of it please we've done it my friends let's go oh my god look at how beautiful that looks - This is what a $10,000 website looks like and feels like. And now there's nothing else to do but to actually deploy this. And to do that you can simply come to the top right and just click on Deploy. And we're going to be able to see it live on a public URL. Welcome to Hoops Technology my friends. Most cutting edge technology you have ever seen for basketball. So let's just scroll down here and see this public URL. I'll put it in the link below so you can check it out as well on your own time. I think this will probably require a couple of performance improvements here we see the animations work and that's it my friends we got it if you want to contact us to order basketballs that don't exist just come right here you can get in touch with us so just like that my friend you've built a beautiful website building an amazing website is absolutely incredible but building an actual online business that generates revenue with a website is even better and that's why I highly recommend you check out this video where for 2 hours and 19 minutes I break down every single thing that you need to know to go - Idea to first million dollars in revenue for a software business, meaning a website business or an app business. It is literally the most comprehensive video out there. If you're enjoying my content, I'll see you in the next one. Let's go.

## Transcription

The video that you're about to watch breaks down literally everything I know about making money from coding. This is raw, unedited, unscripted, just me talking directly to the camera and sharing with you pretty much everything I've learned over the past 10 years and how I've been able to earn a full-time income from my coding skills. Now, you should know that this video is broken into four sections, which used to be individual videos in a private community that I had. Now, I'm no longer running that community, so I simply spliced the videos together and and decided to make them publics that all of you could enjoy and learn from them. Now, with that in mind, if you do actually want to put this video into practice and start making money from coding, you do have to have some coding skill. I know a lot of you already have that, but if you don't and you're looking for a roadmap to explain what you need to learn, I have a free introduction course which you can check out from the link below. Now, this is a part of my premium coding course with Course Careers, but the free introduction course is free. You just need to sign up and then you'll get access to it. and you can watch about an hour and a half of completely free content where I give you as much value as I can and break down exactly what you need to do in order to get to a junior software engineer level, which is kind of the level you need to be at when you can start really monetizing this skill. Anyways, I hope you enjoy. Let's get into the video. Hello everybody and welcome to this course where we're going to break down for you how to make money from coding. Now, what I'm going to do is explain to you the value of coding, what my journey looked like and how I started from making 20 bucks a week to now making sometimes over $20,000 per week. And then I'm going to discuss all the different methods you can potentially follow. They're in so many different categories and many of which you've probably never heard of before if you want to earn a full-time income or sometimes much more from programming. I'm then going to talk to you about going from a developer to an entrepreneur, what that looks like and the mindset shift that needs to take place. place if you want to make some serious income. And then I'm going to talk about thinking long-term and how you make this more of a career rather than something you do on the side. Okay, so let's get into it here with this first video value of programming. Well, as we know, learning how to code is one of the most valuable skills you can have. Not only does it teach you problem solving, critical thinking, and reasoning, which is something that's going to carry with you the rest of your life, but the risk to reward ratio is so low. And what I mean by that is it takes you maybe six months, 12 months to get done. decent enough at coding where you actually can provide some value to the marketplace. And then in that time, you're immediately able to start making a ton of money and the upside is completely uncapped. You could easily be making hundreds of thousands of dollars your second year being a developer. I know developers who have made 300, $400,000 in year two or year three of their career. And I know guys that sold startups after just learning how to code for two, three years, right? So the upside is just so high it's potentially uncapped. And even if you go all the way down to the low side, where maybe you land some junior entry level position at a shitty company, you're making 50, 60 K a year, which is still a lot better than you having to go to school, spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, waste four years of your life just to get into a crappy career where there's no growth. There's no upside and you don't have other potential. Now, beyond that, just the number of ways to make money is unlimited. You don't have to get a job. But in fact, a lot of the options I'm going to share with you here don't involve working a nine to five job. You can work anywhere in the world you want. economy you want, which I think is really important. And you don't have to be a US citizen, Canadian citizen, or from let's call it a more A-tier country or first world country. You can be from a developing nation and still make a ton of money. I pay guys that live in Tunisia, like $7,000 per month. I don't know what his exact salary is, but something along that range. Why do I pay him that? Because he knows how to code. I don't care that he lives in Tunisia. If I don't pay him that someone else is going to pay him that they're going to steal him from me. So it's about the value you can provide. It's not where you live. And I think that's really a great thing. This kind of eliminates all those different barriers that you might have in different industries because you can work anywhere you want, whenever you want at any time zone for as long as you want. You could do 70 hour weeks. You could do 20 hour weeks. There's just so many different ways to make money. And I figured this out quite early in my journey. I started learning how to code at 12. By the time I was 14, I was making money, not very much money, but I was tutoring people making 10, 20. 30 bucks a week. By the time I was 16, I was getting paid double what my colleagues were because I knew how to code and I was teaching that at a summer camp. By the time I was 17, I made about $30,000, $40,000 in a single year, which is crazy if you think about being in grade 12 going into first year university. When I was 18, I made over $100,000. When I was 19, I made over $250,000, which out-earned my parents at that point in time. By the time I was 20, I was making high multiple six figures. And beyond that I've made millions of dollars in a single year and in a career simply because I know how to code. Now obviously you compounded, you add skills on top of that but it all came from that foundation. Having a high value skill that allowed you to contribute something to the marketplace is what you need to start with and then you start to realize quite quickly damn I can build this up, build this up, build this up to the point where you're making just so much money. It's actually unbelievable. Now, I don't say that to brag. Genuinely, a lot of you guys know I'm a fairly humble person, but I want to get you pumped up. I want to get you motivated. I want to get you inspired. And this is more of a closed community. So I want to actually share with you kind of those hidden gems and secrets that allow you to really make some serious money to the point where you are actually financially free. You have that location independence and you can work whenever you want, which I think for many of you is the ultimate goal. So with that said, hopefully I got you excited. let's get into the next video here and let's talk about how you actually make money from coding. All right, video two, let's get right into it. I've got 14 different methods to share with you in terms of how you can make money from coding. I'm going to give you a quick explanation of each, but I'm going to try not to drag it on. And at some point in time, we will make a much more in-depth course that breaks down all of these and kind of goes through different strategies, methods, getting clients, et cetera. But for now, I just want to give you all the different methods so you can start experimenting with something today. Now I've got a sheet in front of me. So if you see me reading my monitor, I'm just going through the list. No particular order here. Let's start with number one, freelancing. Now freelancing pretty much means you're kind of on your own and you just do random side jobs. You do gig work. Maybe you're doing some hourly work for a company. Maybe you're finishing some project here, but you can work for whoever you want whenever you want for the number of hours you want. Obviously assuming that you're getting paid by the company for those number of hours. You're not an employee. You don't have benefits. You're not tied down to a set schedule. And usually it's just, you're going to do a certain number of hours or you're going to finish a specific project. I've done freelancing anywhere from $20 per hour back when I was super young and just doing like really some very side gig type work that was super simple that they probably could have done themselves all the way up to 400 us dollars per hour. I know sounds insane, but if you're really good, you can get paid to work at those kinds of rates. Typically now when I do freelancing, the rate is more like 150 to 200 us dollars per hour. And that's a fairly typical rate for a more senior developer who has kind of a broad scope of work that they could potentially be working on. Now, as a junior developer, you can easily be getting paid $50, $60, $70 per hour for freelancing. Depends what company you're working for and what you're doing, but you can make quite a bit of money. And where the real money is at is when you do project-based freelancing. So, for example, you build a website for someone and you just charge them a flat fee. And you do that based on the value you're going to be providing them, not how long it's going to take you. Right? So you can make a website for five grand and it takes you five hours. You just now got paid a thousand dollars per hour. The person doesn't care how long it took you. They just wanted their website done. Right? So freelancing, all kinds of stuff you can do there. Next tutoring. This is my personal favorite one. Like if you're just getting started out, not only is this really good for you, but it's the easiest way to start making money immediately because people always need one-on-one help. And you can find clients, quite easily because for example, let's say you're in university. You can literally go to the wall and you can post a sheet of paper that has those little tabs where they can take your phone number or they could take your email. You can say, Hey, I'm doing one-on-one tutoring for computer science or for whatever the courses that you want to tutor doesn't even have to be programming in this case. So many people need tutoring and I've done tutoring sessions anywhere from probably five or $10 an hour up to $200 per hour when you're dealing with a really rich client who really wants stuff to get done. Speaker 2 : So please don't rule this one out. Like if you're just getting started and you have a little bit of knowledge and like, you're better than some other people around you, you can absolutely teach them even the little bit that, you know, if that helps someone pass a course, if that helps someone finish an assignment or get, you know, a C plus when they would've failed, like that is still super valuable to them. And you can even get into group tutoring where you do a session with say 10 people, they each pay you 20 bucks. There you go. That's $200. So really a business model to look into. And my personal favorite One that I've made probably in lifetime, maybe $20,000, $30,000 from doing. And it's been very much on the side, not something I took super seriously. Next, tutorials. Now, obviously if you have a big social media presence like mine, you can just post tutorials and you get paid by AdSense and whatnot. But a lot of companies actually need people to make tutorials for specific frameworks, libraries, languages, whatever it may be. There's quite a few jobs that a lot of people don't know about that are actually specifically like, technical writing or it's making video tutorials for a platform. I have friends that have pretty much no social media presence, but are pretty decent teachers and they get paid something like $2,000 per tutorial video they make for other YouTube channels. So they don't have a big YouTube channel themselves. They just were able to kind of connect with this company and they now make videos that post on this company's YouTube channel and they get paid a flat US dollar rate per tutorial that they're making. Now you can also do tutorials in other mediums, right? tax-based tutorials blog articles all kinds of different avenues here and I believe even if you go the medium route we're doing like medium based tutorials you can get paid for those or at least you can get some exposure next personal brand now this one It's obviously going to be a lot more dedicated. Some of you are probably going to have to take more full time or eventually you'll want to be taking it more seriously. But even if you're a complete beginner, like starting a series, like, you know, learning to code in 100 days, right? And every single day you post a TikTok video or you do an Instagram post and kind of share what you're learning. You can very quickly build up a following. And some of the best channels when it comes to personal brands are people that are relatable, right? So in my case, it's hard for me to be like, oh yeah, you know, I'm just learning how to code and I've been doing it for 10 years. You guys can't relate to me. Like I am an expert level programmer at this point as much as I can teach you stuff. It's not that relatable type content, right? So if you're someone who's more of a beginner intermediate, you can make a personal brand related to coding related to your journey. It doesn't have to be tutorials and technical content. Like I would do, it can be more lifestyle and what it looks like learning coding in 2024 or whatever year you're watching this. completely from scratch. Something to consider a lot of opportunities here and having a personal brand will bring you so many opportunities that you've just never thought of before. You'll get job offers, you get people wanting to do brand deals, you get collaborations, you'll meet incredible people. And obviously in my situation I never like was really trying to build a personal brand but it kind of just happened. And then once I started seeing all those great benefits I took it a lot more seriously and built mine up right next we have sass this is software as a service And this is great because you can just go out there and you can build some software that people want to pay for. And there's so much shitty software out there that people pay for just because it's the only thing they know or it's what they rely on for their day-to-day. And you can see so many different companies that have software as a service, whether it's good or whether it's bad, they make so much money. And with SaaS businesses as well, if you have a lot of recurring revenue, some monthly or annual revenue, you'll end up getting a pretty large multiplier if you do decide to ever exit that business. I have a close friend of mine who ran a SaaS business, wasn't that great of a developer. Like he was really more at that intermediate stage, was nowhere near where I would be or some of the other people in this community. He built a SaaS business. I don't remember exactly what the service was, but it was something relatively simple. I think he ended up getting about 10,000 users and then he sold the company. Now he didn't make millions of dollars doing that, but he made a few hundred thousand dollars. That was great. And now he's got a cushion. He can go do whatever the hell he wants. So something to consider if you are interested in building software, think about, okay, who can I actually service here? What's going to be valuable. How can I get paid for it? And you can make a fair amount of money. And even if it fails, it's great experience and it's something that you can throw on your resume and that looks good. Next mobile apps. So many shitty mobile apps out there that people pay a lot of money for especially things like you've got fitness trackers, weight trackers, habit trackers, like anyone can make one of those types of apps. And if you're able to market it well, get a few users. You have some in-app currency or something along those lines. You can make fair, a fair amount of money from mobile applications. So again, another method. And also obviously if you like building mobile apps, something fun to do and try to get a monetization angle on that. Next we have WordPress or Shopify themes now not directly related to coding, but something that can be really, really lucrative, especially if you get one of those top themes. So go on Shopify, right? And see how many different themes there are. Obviously you can pay for them. You can also buy WordPress themes. You can buy just pre-made HTML and CSS templates. And if you get quite a few downloads, you can get some high volume. You can make a lot of money. Definitely check that out if you've never seen it because it's not that much work. You know, maybe it takes you a few days. You build this theme out. And I mean even if it sits there and it gets a few sales a month, like that's some great side income that I don't think anyone will be complaining about. Next we have technical writing. Now, writing documentation is a huge pain. No one wants to do it. I don't want to do it. A lot of you probably don't want to do it. But if you're into writing and if you're actually good at English, this can be a really valuable thing to do because you don't need to be an expert level programmer. What people are really looking for is okay, they're decent at programming like they've got the basics down, they're good enough that they understand what's going on. And they're a good writer. Those two skill sets combined really make you quite valuable and you can get full time jobs doing this or you can do it more as a freelance or a side gig. Next, we have helping small businesses. Now this kind of can tie in with any of the other things that I mentioned before, but some of my favorite projects are where you just go to a small business that doesn't have a website or they don't have any marketing or they don't have some tool that would save them like tens of hours per week and you build it for them. And the great thing is that it doesn't need to be perfect. It doesn't need to be amazing. You're not building a new website for Facebook. You're building it for like the local bakery down the street. And it's a lot more relatable. However, it does involve some sales, which could be A bit difficult for some of us, right? Now just to give you a specific example for this one actually when I did work at the summer camp, not necessarily a small business but it kind of fits in this category. I noticed that the admins that were in like the head office, they would do scheduling for all of the different groups of kids manually every single week so they would like pick them out, they would choose all the activities they're going to be doing, they would like have to cross. Boss reference they had like 20 sheets of paper out and they were literally going with like highlighters and x's And it took them like a whole day to like do the scheduling. It was insane what they were doing So I came in and I saw them doing this one day and I was like, what the heck? What are you doing? And they're like, oh we're doing all this uh, this scheduling I was like, can you okay just walk me through like how this works? They kind of told me their process I was like, okay, give me like a few hours So I went downstairs coded out some software that just did exactly what they were doing Brought it to them and said hey, like how's this is this better and they like it completely changed their life because now they had another day every single week where they didn't have to do this. There was a little bit of manual checking that was involved with the software that I had, but it saved them multiple hours per week. And you have to ask yourself like how much money would you be willing to pay for something like that? That could save employees, you know, two employees in this case, eight hours a week or something along those lines, right? So if you can build this kind of automation software, small tools, you can just help increase efficiency even a slight bit. you can get paid a fair amount to do that and you're actually providing real value. Okay, so now into some more unique ones, ones I don't think you guys may have actually considered before. And what I've got here is bug bounties. Now quite a few companies release bug bounties. Now what this means is if you find a bug or an exploit in the software and you report it to them, they'll pay you. So they'll give you a flat fee amount based on the type of bug, the severity of the bug, et cetera. Now famously Google had some bug bounties that were like a million dollars And nowadays, a lot of new companies will do this. One because they want to get some more exposure. They want people using their stuff. But obviously they want to make sure that if they're growing really quickly, you know, they don't crash and burn because they had a few exploits or bugs that completely burned the business down. I remember I was at ETH Denver. You guys, some of you may know this conference. And I was sitting beside some guy in like the cafeteria and I was asking him what he does. And he said, oh, I do bug bounties. I was like, what do you mean you do bug bounties? Like, yeah, literally all I do every single day is I just go and I like have a bug bounty. hack different websites and companies. And I get paid to do that. I'm like, like you make a living doing that. And he's like smiled and like looked at his friend and he was like, yeah, like the last one I did was $250,000 for a bug bounty. And he didn't make it sound like it was super overly complicated. I'm sure, you know, it's probably beyond what many of us have been able to do, but something to consider, like if you're into that, you do ethical hacking, bug bounties can be pretty cool and you can make a ton of money. And there's a lot of these newer companies that have some pretty lucrative bug bounties that might not be, you know, to the level of one, like Google. Now next we've got hackathons. Now, if you guys are good, if you have a team, if you want to build something out, if you like this experience, you can actually make a lot of money by competing in hackathons or in different coding competitions and winning. Now, is this going to be something you do as a full-time job? Probably not, but it's worth considering like if there's a local hackathon or this one you want to go to, first of all, a lot of times you can actually get paid to go. It's like they'll cover your flights. They'll cover all your expenses. It's a great time. You learn a lot. You meet some good people. So already the experience is great I've done a few in my life. I didn't win any of them, but I did quite enjoy them. And if you win like cash prizes could be $20,000 for the winning team or you can get some partnership with this company where you get a new computer. Like there's a bunch of cool stuff you can get from hackathons, especially from some of the bigger ones. So something worth considering. Next we have grants. There's quite a few companies that actually give out grants to people that work with their technology or that build something on it. Now this is especially big in the Web3 space right now. There's a lot of blockchain companies that have a ton of funding from venture capital firms and they need to spend it. And they also need people to use their software. So literally pay people $50,000 to build one of the top projects on this chain. Or in the case of some companies I've worked with, even if you're not a crazy experienced developer, if you go and you build something on the chain, then they'll just pay you money to do that. So you can go to them because I hear here's my idea. You're not competing with anyone. And fund your ideas that you have some time to work on this. You've got some experience they'll want to maybe do like a survey with you or something, or they want to like demo your project when it's done. But the idea is there's so much opportunity out there and there's companies that literally have grant funds that are in like the tens of millions of dollars that they're giving out to hundreds of different projects because they're trying to encourage people to use their technology. Now, lastly, I've got a great one here, which is UGC user generated content. The tech field recently has really been expanding more into this influencer marketing and specifically into the more micro influencers. So people that don't really have any following or maybe have like 5,000, 10,000 followers, like a very small amount and user generated content is kind of, I guess, a field of this where essentially what you can do is as someone with no following at all, you can make content that shows you using specific technology, programming languages, frameworks, whatever it may be. And companies will pay you for that because they'll then repurpose it as an ad or they'll use it for kind of organic media and post it on their social medias. I actually have quite a few friends that do this user generated content. Usually what it will involve is you need to set up like a bit of a profile. file for yourself. You want to, you know, refine your Instagram or refine your TikTok or whatever. And you start working with companies for free where they'll just send you some product for free that you'll kind of make like a little video about demoing you use it or just showing it kind of in organic life. Now, once you build a little bit of experience doing this and you make some good videos and the companies like them, then you start negotiating for rates, right? So it could be, okay, we're going to get $200 per video. We're going to get $500 per video. And eventually if you have any kind of social media following, you'll start to kind of do a hybrid type deal where you make the video for the company, you give them the ability to use it. And then you also post on your social media and they'll pay you for that reach and exposure. I don't want to get into this too much because I'm not an expert and we are probably going to make a full course breaking down all of these really, really in depth. But I wanted to share that idea with you because I think for quite a few people, that's quite interesting. And in the tech space is not as saturated as like general product reviews, right? So you actually can get in there and probably immediately start getting some deals. There's a lot of marketplaces opening up now for user generated content that kind of are connecting the brands with the creators, which is quite interesting. So there you go guys, that is my list of 14 different ways to make money from coding. Now I challenge you before clicking off this video, pick one of these and actually give them a solid shot. I'm not going to say it's easy. I'm not going to guarantee you're going to make money in your first day or your first hour working on this. These things are hard. And one of the reasons why they make a lot of money is because many people aren't actually going to do them. If it was easy, everybody would do it. And then we would have no leverage here using coding as a skill. But I challenge you pick one of them. No excuses. I guarantee no matter who you are, no matter where you're from, no matter your experience, you can do at least one. And again, I really challenge you to work on them. Share your experience with us in the community. If you've done any of these in the past and you have some more insight you want to share, we would love to see your posts. With that said, let's get into the next video where we're going to talk about a bit of a mindset shift you need to have if you want to make these successful. All right, so let's get into video three, which is going to tie nicely in with video two. Now in that video, I mentioned all the different ways to make money coding and notice that I didn't mention a job as one of them. Now, obviously this is a way to make money coding. I just thought it was pretty obvious. And that's kind of a cheat for me to put in there because obviously you guys know that you can go get a software developer job and you can make money doing that. What I wanted to do is start getting you thinking about ways that you can make money without having a job and how you can actually transform your life to be something a bit more unique and different than just being a nine-to-five employee. But in this video, I do want to encourage you to ask yourself what is it that you want out of this skill? So learning how to code and what is it that you want out of life? And the reason I'm asking you that is because there's two very, very different paths you can go down here. but you don't really want to be jumping between them a ton because it will really limit the amount of progress you can make in either of these directions. Now, direction one is to get a software developer job. You usually will not start out at a huge tech company. Most people don't. You'll start somewhere, probably a shitty company and you will work your way up that company and then switch different roles and switch different jobs. Now, if you get a career in software development, if you're a good developer, this is actually a pretty stable career, especially once you've built a bit of experience. You make a very good amount of money. And if you are fortunate enough to get into a large tech company or even into a startup that ends up doing really well, you can become a millionaire quite quickly and you can make a lot of money that is a much more guaranteed income source than if you were to be an entrepreneur. For example, if you work at Google, by the time you've been working at Google for four or five years, you will very reasonably be at close to $300,000 per year in total compensation. If you are able to climb that rank even higher, many people just stay there, but you could climb higher. It is not unreasonable to be making 500, 600, $700,000 per year. I know people in their mid thirties that make 800 to $900,000 per year working at a big tech company. Some of them are not even named companies. Now they aren't named companies, but a lot of them are privately traded or they're just not ones that you may have even heard of before. They just do something very, very specific and they're very good at their job. So with that said, like if your goal is just make as much money as possible, you may want to consider going down that route. And if you really grind to get into those type of companies and you really focus on your career, playing the politics, learning how the corporate culture works, you're going to be successful in that realm. And it's going to be more guaranteed. You know, by the time you're in your mid thirties, you're going to be a millionaire no matter what, if you stay on that path. Now we have the other side, right? Which is kind of doing your own thing, being an entrepreneur. Now, the advantage here is that you get all those levels of freedoms that you don't have when you work for a company. You have time freedom, you have location freedom. And for the financial freedom is the one that you need to build yourself. Whereas on the other side, you don't have time freedom and you don't location freedom typically, but financial freedom is more guaranteed. So you kind of have to pick, you know, what side do I want to be on? And what do I want to do? So actually ask yourself that question, sit down, have like a deep introspection section session, sorry, and think about it carefully because this is not for everyone. Now, if you are someone who wants to be more of an entrepreneur, you need to realize that this is a journey just like it is going down the career path. The thing is that your reward can be way higher, right? The upside is completely uncapped. You can make unlimited amount of money. There's no cap on your potential. It's really just up to you what you end up doing. And typically, if you really, really go hard at it and you know what you're doing, you're going to grow it and it's not really going to be stagnant, right? It's going to continue going up and up. Now, with that said, to do that, you have to put in probably more work than you would. trying to climb the career in like a corporate nine to five ladder. And you will be sacrificing quite a bit at the beginning to get to that point. So I think that's enough. I think you guys probably understand the advantages of entrepreneurship, disadvantages, et cetera. Now let's talk about how you make that shift, especially in development. Well, you need to immediately start thinking more like a CEO boss business person than you do like an employee or like a developer. And this is very difficult because our brains typically, if we're in this space are wired. to be thinking critically, thinking logically, problem solving, reasoning. As much as those are important in business, that's not necessarily what's going to make you a lot of money, right? You can be a good developer and still be broke or still not be very good at a lot of the skills that I listed in that previous section. So you need to immediately kind of turn off the, oh, I'm an employee hat and I work for $50 an hour or I do this or, oh, my time is worth X amount of money to how do I scale a business? How do I Leverage my time as well as possible and this is the big word leverage, right? How do I use my time as effectively as possible for some of you that is simply working for $50 an hour? But for others it's doing different types of activities and trying to buy back your time and outsource different things Now I'll give you a specific example because I know this is kind of bait. Let's say that you are good developer Okay, you can do pretty much anything you encode anything out. You're really good. You're out like an expert level now in you could simply work for everyone. And no matter what you do, you could just charge $200 an hour. Now, you know, you're going to make $200 an hour at this point. Like you are kind of an entrepreneur because you're doing freelance stuff. But at the end of the day, you're really just working as an employee and like your amount of income is limited by the amount of hours that you can work. Now, if you were to, instead of just charging by hour charge per project, and based on the value you provide, you can completely substantially change the amount of money you're going to make. It You could go work for like a little mom and pop shops. Or when I say go work, I mean do a project for them. You could maybe make them a website. And the value you're going to provide them is you're going to give them some exposure. And let's say you can maybe generate them 10 new clients a month. Maybe each client that comes into the bakery or whatever store it is pays $30, $40, $50 as an average purchase. You've generated, let's say approximately $400 in value in one month. The reason is because well, that's how much value they got from what you built. They didn't pay you because you were good at building a website They paid you because you could get them clients, right? And they would have paid someone else the same, if not more, if they could have got them more clients, if it came from something other than the website. So in this case, you're not framing your skill set in the light of, oh, I'm good at making websites. I mean, yes, that's what you're going to do for them. But you're saying, I'm going to get you clients. The way I will do that is because I have this skill set that's in development. Now that's a pretty low leverage or pretty low value use of your time because you're working for very minimal value that you can generate. Now let's say we move it up a little bit and you now go and you work for a big company. Let's say you're doing freelancing for Microsoft, and what you're going to do is you're going to build this automation tool that's going to save 1,000 hours a month because all these employees will now no longer need to do this task that's really repetitive and that can be automated. I know this is an extreme example but just bear with me to get to the point here. So now in this instance, you've saved 1,000 hours of developer time per month. How much is developer time worth? Let's say on the low side it's worth $1,000. You can do that multiplication. Now you've generated a hundred thousand dollars in value or whatever that amount ends up being, right? What's changed is not what you're capable of doing. You're a developer. You can write code. You could have just written code for either of these companies at $200 per hour. Instead, what you've done now is you've changed who you're working for and the amount of value you can potentially provide. And the amount of value you can provide was not really based on the skill that you're doing. It's based on the person that you're working for. and the client that you have. So this is just one example of how you shift from the employee mindset to the business mindset. You start looking for the places where you can inject the most amount of value, and you then extract a portion of that value, right? So if I were to generate $100,000 in value for a client, I'm not taking $100,000. Maybe I take 30 or $40,000, some percentage of it because that's reasonable. Now, I'll give you an example in my case making YouTube videos, right? I could easily make a YouTube video, and I can promote some like... Stupid thing like a fidget spinner, right? Like you guys would probably buy it. Some of you will buy that right some of you will enjoy It but the thing is the amount of value I'm providing by promoting that is pretty low because it's a low-cost item Even if hunters have you buy it, it's still only gonna generate like a few grand right not that much in sales Whereas if I were to promote a really high ticket item, that is something that's much more more in the niche that makes a lot more sense, I'm going to be able to get much more money or get paid a lot more money to do that because it's just more reasonable, right? It makes more sense. It can generate more money for the client. So rather than me pricing, say a brand deal, which is something I do all the time based on, okay, I always just charge $4,000 because I get this amount of views. The price for my brand deal depends completely on the company that's working with me with that brand deal. If it's a company where I can't generate that much value, I can't charge that much. If it's a company where I can generate a ton of value, then the price goes up. Now, again, like I know this is kind of basic stuff, but what I'm trying to get you to think about is that you need to use your time and position yourself in areas where you can generate the most amount of money. And that doesn't really rely on what your skill set is. It's really who you're serving and what you can do for other people. Right? So that means picking the best clients, finding the best opportunities, building the best partnerships. And you can do this in many different ways that I want to get into much more in depth in another course. But you need to completely shift the way your brain works from like, I'm worth this much per hour to where can I go? What can I do where I can generate as much value as possible and then take some of that value back? That's really the key. And that's what I've learned over the past 10 years, starting by doing what many of you probably do, just charging per hour or charging a flat fee or doing something like that. So saying no, Like I need to find the areas where I am actually leveraging my time the best and where my time equates to the most amount of money. And again, a lot of the times it's not really your skillset. It's who you're working for the clients and what you're able to do for them. So that's just one small example. So that's the key point of what you need to do early on is you need to discover and find where you are most valuable, right? I'm not saying this is easy. I'm not saying you know this day one, and you do that by trying a lot of different things, experimenting, messing around, trying this, trying that failing in different avenues, tutoring, realizing, okay, it's not really worth my time to tutor. Instead, I'm going to do this. Oh, this actually, I feel like I'm getting paid a good amount. Okay. Let me try something like this, right? You keep moving around and adjusting until you tap into where you are actually the most valuable. And what's going to tell you that is when people start paying you money to do those things, which also means you have to be comfortable asking for money that you've never received before setting some crazy high price that you don't think anyone will actually pay. Like you mess around and find your value in the marketplace by experimenting and seeing what people will pay. Just bluntly with you guys, if I do a brand deal or something along those lines, I will just throw random numbers to companies that maybe I don't care that much about working with to try to figure out where I lay in the marketplace. Because if company A is willing to pay me $25,000, then company B, they're probably going to be close in that range. And I never would have known that if I was too scared to ask for that figure in the first place and potentially be rejected or potentially fail on that deal. Now, once you found that and you're like, okay, this is my thing. Like, this is what I'm good at. This is where I can actually make a lot of money. You need to understand how do I do more of that thing, right? So it's optimizing your time. So now maybe you're hiring an employee. Maybe you're getting a virtual assistant. In my case, I have editors. I have agents. I have people that work like for my YouTube channel, which is the main thing that I run. And why do I do that? Because my time is better spent making the videos than it is negotiating with brands or it is editing videos or other things along those lines. So you start to to really optimize the systems and figure out, how do I do more of the thing that I'm getting the most amount of value from? And why can't I do 10X, 20X, 30X, 40X, that thing. Once you figure that out, you can build the volume and you can start to actually scale. Now at the same time, you also then have to ask yourself, where's the balance here? Do I wanna keep doing this? Do I even wanna scale? And the nice thing with an entrepreneur is that you have control and you can just make 100, 200K a year if you get to that point side, don't really need much more than that. I'm happy just doing this, hanging out, work in 20 hours per week. And that's the greatest benefit of going down this path. Now there's a lot more I could talk about here. And I realized this is a little bit of a rant video wasn't super structured, but I wanted to just kind of eject in you the different ways you think about things, right? A lot of people think about a skill as simply a salary they can make per year or an amount of money they can make per hour. It's the wrong way to think about things when you go into that entrepreneurial route. Again, I keep repeating it. You just have to figure out what value do you provide and where can you provide the most? You can then tap into that and take it out. Two people can have the exact same skill set and provide vastly different amounts of value based on the type of tasks they're actually completing with that skill set. And that's what you need to think about. So that's going to wrap up video three. Let's move on to video four. So let's get into video four. We talk a bit more strategically here with thinking long term. Now, this is many different meetings, but generally speaking, I want to make sure that any of the activities I'm sharing with you here or even just your ability to make money with coding doesn't die in a few years. And then this is something you can do sustainably over a longer period of time because again, what's the point if we only can do this for two, three, four years? Yes, you can make some quick money, but for me, it's going to be a lot more time than I would have needed. For me, I'm always about building the skills, building the business, building the ability to generate wealth and not just doing it over a very short period of time. And then dying out and having to find something else. This should be something that's sustainable. It should be something long-term at least that's the way that I look at it. You may look at it differently, but I'm going to share with you here my perspective. Now, when I say thinking long-term, first of all, that means before we jump into trying to earn as much money as possible, we want to build that foundational skill of coding. Anyone who's going to make a lot of money with this has to first be decent at development. You don't need to be an expert, but you need to be confident in your abilities. I think confidence is the key word there. This is something that exudes pretty much everyone that you talk to and it's something that really affects you internally whether you realize it or not. You've probably had this where you walked into a job interview applying for a position where you're not qualified. Even though you might be able to fake it a little bit, generally people can tell when you're confident in what you're doing and not. And even the way you speak, the way you answer questions, what you think about things internally yourself subconsciously are affected by the fact that you know that you're not actually qualified for that role. The same goes in reverse. You go into an interview, you know, you're overqualified, you know, you're going to kill this job. You know that this is like exactly what you're meant to do. You're going to really exude that confidence is going to be very obvious to everyone in the room and you yourself are going to speak in a different way, carry yourself in a different way because you actually know that you can do the thing. And even if no one else knows that just you knowing it yourself. really makes a huge difference. And I found that personally myself quite a bit when I started programming, when I started posting YouTube videos, I wasn't that confident. I didn't have the accomplishments or the achievements to actually say, Hey, like I'm a great developer. And it took me a fair amount of time to build that up to the point where I could speak more confidently, right? I could come across like I actually know what I'm talking about because I did and I was confident in myself. So please first build that skill and it's going to help you in pretty much every area of life. and business. So let's say we've done that. We have the confidence. What's next? Well, there's three main things I want to talk about in this video, and that's being a professional reputation and reliability. And we'll talk about a few other small things as well. Now, let's start with being a professional. No matter what area of business you're in, no matter what you do, you want to be as professional as you possibly can. Now, what that means is even simple things like using proper punctuation and grammar, having an email signature, answering on time, being flexible. fast to reply, showing up on time and being reliable. I mean, these things all kind of tie in with each other. Everyone wants to work with someone who's professional, right? Being a professional just shows that you actually know what you're doing. You've done this before and that you can actually deliver on whatever it is that you're promising. Now I'll give you some specific examples here because this is really applicable, especially in the YouTube space, which is where I obviously make a lot of money. Now on YouTube, you have, let's just be blunt here. A lot of kids, right? And you have a lot of people who are like vloggers or entertainers, or they don't actually have any real skillset. They just like have a bunch of followers and they do silly goofy stuff online. Now with a few exceptions, many of these people do not know what it's like to run a business. They don't know what it's like to be professional. They don't know what it's like to even work in any kind of corporate world. They're in a place where like you have to maybe put a dress shirt on, or you have to speak in a certain way, or there's manners or formalities or whatever. And you guys can say what you want about that. But the truth is there's so many people, especially in this content space that are like a nightmare to work with, right? For example, maybe you'll sign a deal with them and they just don't respond to you, right? They won't reply to you. They won't show up for a call. Maybe it takes them three weeks to cancel on you. Maybe they don't deliver. Maybe they're late. It may be even on the brand side, maybe you pay really late or you don't hold up the deal with the creator or whatever ends up happening, right? There's just so many examples of unprofessionalism. When that happens, obviously that ruins your reputation and it makes you undesirable to work with even if you're able to contribute a lot of value. So you want to no matter what you do Be a professional in that space. And I guarantee you, it's going to help you in so many ways that you won't even realize. And you're just going to be someone who's desirable to work with. I get a lot of repeat deals. I get a lot of repeat customers and clients. And one of the main comments I get is that my operation is tight. Things are organized. We're controlled. We reply to people. I'm easy to work with. I answer really quickly. I'm diligent. I make sure that if there's any mistakes or issues, they get resolved immediately. That's what it's like being a professional and you to be that in whatever field you are. So just really keep that in mind. Now, obviously being a professional is going to help with your reputation, right? You want to be someone who's known. So when I say reputation, that means maybe you do things right now that don't make you any money, but the build you a really, really good reputation that could be even in outside of the scope of coding. Maybe you do some volunteer work or maybe you're really into this specific cause you help out with this thing. Maybe you post completely free videos online. like I did for many, many years, building your credibility and building your reputation. And then eventually later on starting to monetize that and starting to cash out on that reputation that you've built. There's a lot of things you can do. that in the short term don't seem like they're really doing anything for you. But what you are building again is that professionalism, that reputation and the fact that you're reliable. And if you can build your presence, especially online things like social media, even medium posts, maybe you're a contributor to an open source project that's going to help you in more ways than you can imagine. It's really difficult to actually put a dollar figure or a value on those contributions. So that's what I'm kind of talking about in this video. There's a lot of strategic things you can do that early on don't immediately give you that reward that long-term are really going to help you and build who you are as a person, right? Build your brand, build your company, whatever it ends up being. Now obviously being reliable, I think this one is pretty simple. You need to be someone that other people can count on, they can rely on. They have to know that if they give you a task, there's no question, there's no reason why you would ever not complete that. And this is a compliment I used to get all the time even when I was younger. that people could just give me something and they just knew it was going to get done. They knew it would be handled, you don't have to worry about it. I'm sure many of you have been in situations maybe like a group project where you just know that the teammates are not reliable. Like you can tell them to do something, you can check in with them every single day, you can do whatever you want and you're almost certain it's just not gonna get done or that you have to take it into your own hands because you can't rely on the fact that it's gonna be finished. No one wants an unreliable partner, no one wants an unreliable wife, no one wants an unreliable client to work with So you need to be reliable and you need to get stuff done. Even if that means sacrificing, right? Because that builds your reputation. So that's kind of what I'm talking about in this video. And those are a few ideas to make you think a little bit more long-term. You don't want to just take quick money, do things fast. You don't want to scam people. You don't want to do things poorly. Sometimes it might take you five hours longer than you thought to complete this project. You could just submit it and get paid right now, but instead you're going to put in that extra work build that reputation. So this guy knows, Hey, he's willing to put in the extra mile. I'm going to come back. I'm going to refer him. I'm going to use him again. So just kind of a general video here and really actually targeted towards a lot of you that are a bit younger or maybe just getting started. Even if you're only 15, 16, 17 years old, be a professional, use proper grammar, be on time, be reliable. This is going to really set you apart, especially at a young age. And there's people that are 30, 40 years old. It'll be taking notes from you. If you really take this advice and actually adhere to it. Anyways, guys, I'm going to wrap that up here and that's actually going to finish this course. I know this was short. I know it's not necessarily a step-by-step guide. There is just so many opportunities. There's so many ways to make money. And as I said, my goal for you is to get the wheels spinning, get you thinking about different things and share with you a few perspectives of mine and some experiences so you can start thinking, okay, what is my strategy going to be? How do I actually want to make money? Do I want to just go work a job? Do I want to do freelancing? Do I want to try these different avenues? And hopefully after this course, you guys are going to go and try at least one of those things that I mentioned. And you're going to share with us in the community how that went for you, whether you failed or whether you succeeded. I would love to hear that. We will be making a more in-depth course on this sometime in the future. We'll let you know when that comes out. For now, thank you for watching and see you in the community.

## Transcription

In this video, I'm going to show you how to make $1,000 a week with your coding skills, and I'm going to share with you the exact strategy that I would use if I would want to monetize my skills right now. Okay, so I'm going to show you the process from A to Z. If you have no experience, I'm going to show you what to do. If you have some experience, I'm going to show you what to do. I'm going to show you how to actually get in touch with these people that desperately need your skills. If you follow this guide, and if you actually give it a shot, I can guarantee you that you'll start making money literally next week. And then, you can use the experience that you got to either continue freelancing and make even more money like this on the side where you are learning to code to get a job or you can use the projects and the experience you gain by yourself to actually land that first developer job way faster compared with most beginners because let's be honest if you saw any of my portfolio reviews you'll see that normal people that are not really watching this channel that are not really implementing the advice that i'm sharing with you will never get a job because they do not have a job getting a job as software developers so follow these steps implement these steps put every single thing that i'm going to tell you into practice and you will get paid literally next week okay so i'm going to have a document that's going to go over every single detail of this process you just have to follow it. I know people who are making five to ten thousand dollars a week doing this. So without any further ado let me show you what this is all about. For most people this is gonna seem like a get rich quick scheme and in fact it is kind of a get rich quick scheme because if you do it right you can end up making a thousand dollars every single week and from there you can scale up you can make even more two thousand five thousand dollars every single week and I know that for Most people these numbers are absolutely, you know out of this world and unbelievable. This is possible I know a lot of people who are making big big big big bucks doing exactly what I'm gonna tell you here Okay, you do not have to aim for $5,000 per week because this is kind of out of your reach and It seems impossible and because it seems impossible you won't do what is required to get there, okay, but I want you to set kind of an unreasonable, reasonable goal. So for example, an unreasonable goal would be making a million dollars per month next week. That's extremely unreasonable. Okay, it's not possible whatsoever. But if you set a goal of I want to make a thousand dollars next month, that is a reasonable, unreasonable goal. okay because if you have no experience you don't even know how to make websites and whatnot and again i'm gonna get into how to do it in a second uh but a thousand bucks is not that much right so it's an reasonable unreasonable goal okay so it is achievable you just don't know how and i'm gonna show you in this video how to do it okay so to be able to actually make a thousand dollars a week with coding you need to know A couple of things. HTML and CSS. That's pretty much it. If you know some JavaScript, wow, you are amazing. You don't need to know React.js. You don't need to know Node.js. You don't need to know TypeScript or Next.js. You don't need to know any of the geeky or nerdy stuff, you know, that the popular influencers are pushing to you. Because if you would go that way, that far on that spectrum... then you'll become a software engineer and software engineers are extremely retarded when it comes to using their skills to make money online so besides creating a sass they cannot do anything else okay they they their skills are too skewed towards one thing which is working in big teams working on big tech okay that is the problem with them again uh probably you want to become one of them at some point. That's why you're watching this channel. I was one of them at some point a couple of years ago So I was the engineer But then when I started trying to make money with my coding skills I realized that I don't need to know that much coding to be able to make money in the real world So that's something that you have to keep in mind. What we want to do is to sell websites Okay, we want to sell websites to to brick and mortar businesses. that do not have an online presence or have a poor online presence okay that's the first thing that we are going to tackle and in part two of this series we'll tackle how to make money online with coding but i'm gonna make that video once this video that i'm making right now for you will hit at least 100 likes and 100 comments okay so by the end of this video please leave a comment please leave a like if you enjoyed the content if you found it insightful if you actually took action on my advice and that's gonna motivate me to make a part two where you learn how to make money online and then when it comes to making money online you can 10x your results that you could get from following this video okay Let's talk about how to actually get clients, you know, because making a website is super easy. It's like stupidly easy in this day and age. The problem is finding someone that will pay you for that website that you are about to make, right? That's the biggest problem. So how do you do that? Well, the problem that you have right now is that you are a beginner, you have no experience and you have no proof that you are even worth getting a shot okay you are again you are expensive to work for free right uh you have no value so we need to craft some value for yourself first before you can even make some money okay so the strategy here is to actually get you uh free clients okay so how do we get free clients We get free clients by finding lists of people. We can use Google and Instagram and I'm going to show you exactly how to do that. But the idea is that we will pitch these people to work for them for free. So let's say, hey, Mr. Anderson, I think that's the name of the guy from Matrix. I have no experience and I want to create a name for myself and I want to make a website for you. I'm going to make the best looking website. that you can even imagine and that website is going to get you so much so many customers that your business won't be able to handle can i do it for you for free he's gonna say yes as long as you sound convincing right and then you say okay if i do it right can you give me one video testimonial and can you refer me to two people that would also need websites and that person will most likely say Yes. Okay, that's kind of how we start this whole thing. We get to work on something for free. We do our best to create the best looking website for that person. That person is going to refer us to two other people. We're going to get a video testimonial. Then from those two other people, we'll start charging money, right? So we can start charging, let's say $250 per website or $500 per website. We'll set up the whole thing for that, for those two people. And then we'll also ask, hey, can you give me a video testimonial and can you refer me to two other people? They'll probably say yes, because if you are an accountant right now, do you know two other accountants? Yeah, you know. Okay, so then if I go to those two other accountants, do they know other two accountants? Yes, they know. Okay, so these people live in networks, okay? They know everyone. So then if you get referred from this person to this person to this person to this person, you'll start to become like the king of a niche. right because let's assume we are starting out with barbers or with massage salons then you'll become very specialized in that niche and everyone is gonna look for websites from you because you got so good at it if you not do this if you're not willing to do work for free starting out you will not have the confidence to charge someone money when i first started teaching programming to people didn't charge any money okay for the first i think two or three months I was helping out people for free. I was doing one-on-one calls for free. I think I was working like 20 hours per week extra with random people that I was finding in Facebook group to learn what these people need. What's important here is that you need to stop thinking about the fact that you need to be an extremely good developer, okay? Because I assume you think that you need to be extremely smart, extremely good as a developer to be able to pull this off. No, you don't have to actually. you can actually buy templates from different shops online right and you can literally pay a hundred bucks to get a theme that is tailor-made for massage salons or for like dentists or for beauty cleanings or whatever it's out there and then you can just use your html and css skills that you learn i'm going to tell you how to learn them later to customize those themes and then use those themes to deliver a great product today it. consumer now you might be saying okay but why would anyone pay me for a template well they don't pay you for the template they don't care about that they care about having the end goal or the end result which is you helping them make more money right have more customers nobody cares how you did it okay and this is something that you need to remove from your head like for example when you use Amazon right and you order i don't know a book do you care if jeff bezos delivers it to you because he is the owner of amazon right or he used to be or whatever no you just care about receiving your book the value that you paid for right and that's how it works here they will pay you to get more customers they don't care if you buy a template and give it to them. Now you might feel like bad about it, right? But that's how commerce works, right? You go to the shop, you buy a Coca-Cola bottle, it's like, I don't know, $3. To make that bottle, it costs $0.2, 20 cents. But then there are markups and fees added for your convenience, okay? That's how you have to think about this. And the interesting part about this whole process is that you don't even have to have to make the website yourself you don't have to customize it yourself so once you start getting good at this once you start to build this agency or this reputation for yourself what you can do is you can outsource the creation of the website to someone else so let's say you have lists of people that want the website from you they all paid you a thousand dollars here two thousand dollars there three thousand dollars there you don't have time to actually build these websites it's uh like physically impossible so you start hiring people from philippines from india from pakistan and because you have the skill you will know if they do or not do the right job and then you just pay them i don't know seven dollars per hour ten dollars an hour and then you profit 900 950 and now you might feel like oh wow i'm taking advantage of these people yeah that's what you're doing you are taking advantage of labor and welcome to becoming a business owner. All you think about is how to get deals coming and then you pay people to do different things for you. And then later, you can also outsource like calling up these people that will later become your customers. So then you have a person that gets you deals. Then you have a person that builds the website for you. And then you're just managing these people. And guess what? Later, if you make even more money you can outsource even this thing right and then you just talk with one person which is going to be the manager that handles all these people like literally this is a business course probably it's so obvious but you would never think about like how this whole business model would work because you're not spending time with the right people on youtube okay that's why this is the process like i'm i'm talking about like a one or two year timeline process for you What I want you to be aware of is that if you do not do every single step that I'm going to tell you about in this video, you will not make any money. So from time to time in this video, I'm going to tell you to take action right now. If you do not take action on that point, then you will not make money. Let's have a look at my Google Chrome. So the strategy. Right, as we discussed is to find someone that you can work for free and then ask them that once they get a website from you, they will give you a video testimonial and two referrals. I hope this makes total sense. And so from those referrals, you can ask to get paid $500 per website and two more referrals. Like if you do this right and if you buy a template and if you are good at HTML and CSS, you should be able to make $1,000 per week, right? Either with making two websites per week and later if you charge $1,000 per website. then you should be able to like make easy four five six seven even ten thousand dollars per month doing this stuff right so for the next customers that will come from your first referral you'll say that you usually charge a hundred dollars a thousand dollars for a website but if they give you two referrals after you work with them and a testimonial at the end uh then you only charge them five hundred dollars okay so by the way i'm gonna give you this uh google doc if uh this video reaches 100 comments so leave a comment below this video with the google doc word and once we have 100 comments i'm gonna send you individually this uh this link so you can actually refer it refer to it later okay so the first step is to choose a niche right so i listed out a couple of niches in here so we have barbers we have dentists we have beauty salons aestheticians restaurants and car dealerships there are way more niches and i don't want to get into it because if i tell you exactly what niche to choose then everyone is going to do exactly that niche and then everything is going to be ultra saturated and it's not going to work okay so these are some ideas i don't recommend you specifically this but to give you a tip regarding like what you should choose think about a niche that charges a lot of money right so let's say car dealerships there are lot of car dealerships with shitty websites let's just look Let's see car dealership. I'm doing it with you live, you know, let's let's have a look at this one. So this These guys don't even have a website as you can see they They are on this app, I guess. Yeah, so as you can see, it kind of sucks. They don't even have a website. It's exactly what I said. Look at this, right? Point is, like there are so many businesses out there that don't have an online presence. Does this look like a... barbershop website like let's just be honest i mean it looks like a junior developer portfolio but who am i to judge right anyway so what you will do is you spend one hour today and i want you to have a spreadsheet like this with the name website phone and last contacted and i want you to fill it up right so for example here we have the new california barbershop right so we'll type in the new california barber shop we'll take the website put it here let's see if we find the phone we found the phone let's copy it we want to get their contacts right because we'll end up calling them later so calling them maybe even getting their uh their email right so let's add a new column over here later we'll start contacting these people and then we'll We'll put here the date on when we contacted them so we know exactly who we contacted, when. So we have some sort of organization in our process. So I want you to get 100 people. This is your first action point. I want you to fill this with 100 people. You can use Google as I showed you I just literally googled barbershop and your area It doesn't have to be your area, but it might help because of time zones and you know Like knowing how to get around so you can use Google search which is free You can use Instagram which is free and then you can also find use this app called d7 lead finder But basically here you say car dealership and then here you can put new york and now you'll get the leads and you literally get a huge list of car dealership like 300 400 of them and you'll get the exact people that were there it's absolutely amazing like you just need to learn how to make money and then you'll see that it's quite easy you need to learn from someone that knows how to do it next step after this my friends is to actually get in touch with these people because Thank you. If you do not fill up this list, that's procrastination. If you filled up the list and you are not calling anyone, that's also procrastination, okay? What you'll do is you'll call them and you'll say something like this. I'm about to sound like every other salesman that calls at this office and asks something. But I'm actually looking to make a website for you for free, no catch whatsoever, because I want to build a name for myself. But I'm not even sure if the owner, is there the owner name there, if you know it, is even okay with this. Right, so you'll say this. And then they'll most likely that's so funny okay uh let me get you the owner and you can talk to him and most people will tell you to fuck off and that's also okay that's fine you'll get rejected people will not want free stuff from you it's gonna be shocking okay you think that you have all this value that you're bringing to this world and people don't want something for free done by you that's gonna be a massive realization okay it's gonna Wake you up is gonna make you extremely mature to realize like how much you actually have to grow that you are a nobody Really when it comes to this if you are able to grow past this You'll make a lot of money. Most people that are watching this video will not make this list. I know that 100% I could charge a thousand two thousand dollars for this because this is like a course that I'm giving you and I'm giving it to You for free because I know for sure that you will not implement it but i want to do my part in telling you how to do it because i want to be able to sleep good at night if you want to be able to sleep good at night after seeing this information you have to put it into practice if you do not put it into practice i hope you're happy with the amount of money that you're making okay because it's not gonna change we have the option to cold call them then we have the cold email uh version right so basically uh the email has two parts which is the subject so the title that you see before you click on an email and then the body i left a few examples here like for example this make me click so i have on my email i have a thing called swipe file so i subscribe to a bunch of emails and then i see you know what kind of headlines they're using and stuff like that and this was seemed pretty good pretty good re your website is down it sounds like We already spoke. And his website is down and he wants to know what it is about, right? Black or white. It could be like black or white. what do you mean click you know it could be like the theme of the website or whatever then remember that thing i asked you know like what thing you asked me click boom open the email right and then in the body we'll actually use a tool called loom the same tool that i'm using right now to record this video and this tool will allow us to show them their website versus their competition let's see if we can find one that has a good website none of this yeah none of these uh places have a good website you know if you find a good website you can say hey look your competitor has a better website than you they have this and this and this thing and this thing and you only have this it doesn't even look like it's a barber shop it looks like you are selling energy or something like that you know and then you can use this tool like for example it's called similar web and you can say look you only get 2.6 000 visitors while your competitor gets this one is worse but you get what i mean right if you need to find a competitor and you can show them like look the potential is this you could end up being like this but you are like this let me help you get to this place because you'll be making more money right that's kind of the idea obviously i had bad examples because I i didn't think about showing you this part of the video to be honest the cool part about this is like okay christian but i'm gonna end up like calling people every single day to get leads uh in the beginning yes a little bit until you like get the idea of how this business works but what's really cool is that you can end up doing something called an upsell businesses have something called an upsell so an upsell is you buy a product and then they say hey you can also get this thing you buy that thing and then they say okay you can also buy this extra thing which is going to give you this amazing result then you end up buying four or five things when you only came to buy one thing right so what we can do is with upsells we can create monthly recurring revenue right so monthly recurring revenue means money that is gonna come to you every single month. without you doing much work right so in the beginning you do a lot of work to get these initial customers because it's okay to do a lot of work you're starting out a new business you don't want to do that forever right in this service-based business that's how you make your money right with things like maintenance so you make the website and you say hey uh i'll charge you i don't know 100 bucks per month to maintain your website to fix different things that appear to add new stuff if i see them fit to analyze the performance you know to make your website look better and feel better or if you have any problems i'll fix them it's like a security guarantee then we have pay-per-click google ads you'll say something like hey by the way uh you have this car dealership right you are giving amazing results to your customers you have this amazing website why not rank higher in google so when People search for a car dealership, they will come straight to you, they'll find your website, you have all the testimonials there, all the price list, all that good stuff. I can do that for you for $500 a month. Or not even that, I'll do it for you for $100 a month and you can pay me a percentage of all the deals that come through the ads campaign from Google. It takes a couple of hours per week to do that and then you make extra cash. Then you have SEO, right? You'll say, hey, Look, you have a nice website. Let's work on the SEO, which means search engine optimization. And in six months from now, whenever someone types in dentist Warsaw, you'll show up on the first page for free. You don't have to pay for any ads. People will click on your website. They will see again, testimonials and everything. And then you'll get all the customers and you have to pay $0 to Google. You just pay me to make sure that your website is optimized for search engines. and you just profit how does that sound and they'll be like amazing right so this is like a very long video okay and i went quite in depth in certain things although i just scratched the surface so this is maybe 0.5 percent about what i know about like starting a business like this and I would recommend you to start doing the things that I told you to do and start getting paid. If you want to learn the skills to be able to do this you have two options you either go on YouTube again and try to find all the random resources it's going to take you a few months maybe six nine months till you are able to have some decent skills when it comes to this or you can learn them in one or two weeks. in my mentorship program okay it's as simple as that so this is the first time when ryan attempts this let's see if it looks good okay it looks good there are maybe a few issues so this is his first time trying out css properly okay uh with my technique worked pretty well okay let's look at another one let's type in apple all right so if you want to learn how to do stuff like this really fast without wasting your time apply for my mentorship program like literally it's made to make you money all you have to do is do the work so click the link in the description the first one and i have an amazing offer and the offer is i get you job ready in nine months or less and if i fail to do so i'll give you all your money back and five thousand dollars for wasting your time it's gonna be written in the contract so i'm pretty much legally obligated to follow through with my promise um so yeah if you're interested in that the first link in the description and just give this thing a shot at least fill up your list of people and call them see what results you get if you want this actual guide just leave a comment below with the word or the two words and then when we have a hundred comments i'm gonna leave you i'm gonna leave you with the link and then i will get to work on the second part which is showing you how to use fiverr and upwork to make even more money okay so that's pretty much it i hope you enjoyed this video bye

# I asked developers how much MONEY they make

## Transcription

How much money do you make as a developer? Um... Ooh, I mean... Yeah, I make around... I would say... My first job, my salary was... Today, me and my friend are at GraphQL Summit asking these developers how much money they make. And wait till you get the end because the numbers get crazy. Yo, what's up bro? Oh, bro Postman?! Every developer on our channel knows about Postman. So what would be one piece of advice for somebody who is looking to get their first job? Yeah, I don't have a degree. I'm from Oklahoma City so there's not a whole lot of tech there. So what I really did is I really contributed to a lot of open source projects. I didn't actually apply for my postman job they reached out to me. So... So how much money do you make as a developer? Um, I make six figures and that does the SE1. So that's like entry levels software engineer and I have great benefits. So we're here with Ben, if you're comfortable sharing. How much do you make as a developer now? - Ooh, I'll give you a range boys. I'm not gonna give you at all. 100 to 110. So I got an internship actually in college. I should say that's a major key. You get at least like a three month internship that'll negate any sort of experience because then like you've gone through the process at that point, you know, you've gotten through the software development life cycle. Once you've done that, most jobs are like, all right, you're good to go. - My name is Camille. I'm 24. I am a front end software engineer. I work at Peloton in New York City. So your first job was with Peloton? Yes, my first job was with Peloton. And how did you go about getting your first job? I applied to probably 200 companies. Maybe like 10 people will be like "Hey!" Never forget that people want to refer you because they get referral bonuses. If you don't mind sharing, how much did you make on your first developer job? So my first job, my salary was 110. I had a 15K signing bonus and my equity was... - You got equity as well? Wow, that's awesome. - Well, Peloton stock, it used to be worth a lot more. - We've had an amazing time meeting people. One piece of advice. If you thought $125,000 is a lot, then you'll be surprised to see what some of these developers are getting paid at the biggest companies. The thing is, developers are often shy about their salaries. How much money do you make as a software engineer? I will not reveal that. I'm not comfortable sharing that. I don't want to answer that. No, I can't do that, sorry. No worries. Will we find people willing to share? Yo, that is awesome Nice to meet you, Mark. What's it like working at Netflix? Ooh, I mean... It's great. It's fun. It's a big company but you get a lot of freedom. I've talked to people and they're like: "Hey, even over sometimes a senior developer that prefers somebody who's maybe junior and but is like really hungry, but they don't have the greatest amount of experience. Is it possible they could work at a company like Netflix? I mean, anything is possible. I think it depends like keep focusing on your skills. Skills are really truly what matters trying to show your skills through other means because clearly you don't have like experience. So understanding what you use, we often use like frameworks and libraries, actually reading a lot of code, digging into those libraries, I think is super important. So if you're comfortable sharing, how much do you make as a software developer? I don't think I'm comfortable sharing. Got it. Well, thank you so much, Mark. Appreciate it. Now that was unfortunate, but these next developers are earning more money. multiple six figures. - I'm here with Dalvin. - So my advice for somebody who wants to get into tech for the first time would be start trying to learn on YouTube. You don't have to go to a bootcamp or pay money if you don't want to. Start creating projects that you're interested in, doing stuff that you like. If I'm into sneakers, I'ma try to make the Nike app again and put it on my portfolio and resume. - Are you willing to say how much you make right now? - Yeah, so currently I make 146. - Damn That is amazing. It's basically fake it till you make it. That's my best advice. So I'm here with Trent. Tell us about yourself, what do you do? Sure I'm a full stack engineer at Glassdoor. I've been doing this for about seven years now and I actually... In college I was a pre-med major and switched to this last minute. And it turned out to be a pretty good decision. I never would have thought I'd be here at a tech conference and here I am. Do you want to share how much you made at your first CS job? Sure. I made uh... it was 70 grand. 70 grand. In Chicago. In Chicago. And then how about now? What do we give a range of like how much you're making? I think I make 180 grand now after six, seven years. Congratulations. Yeah. That's amazing. Yeah. Which is nothing for, you know, California, but Chicago. The cost of living in California. I'm here with Alex, guys. So I'm a DJ, right? Yes. I needed to make an app to help me organize my music. I didn't know how to code anything. But the thing that I learned through that process was that I didn't hate it. Because one thing that I see a lot of newcomers come in, like they see the price tag and then they get a month into the job and they realize they don't really like coding that much. Join a community, try building something, figure out that process for yourself and if you like it then you should be good to go. How much money do you make as a software developer? 2013 I started 40 grand. After a year there, they bumped me to 75. By the end of 2018 I was lead dev for 130. And now I'm in that range like 200-ish. That is amazing Man I would say... So I've hired a lot of junior devs. If you're totally fresh, you're probably looking in the 60/70 range which I think is still really good these days. If you thought $200,000 was a lot, these next two developers are paid crazy. Crazy. All right, so I'm here with Anthony. Tell us about yourself. Went to college for computer science ended up dropping out and just going Self-learning route anyone can get into this career path. It's not like for intelligent people I've seen people who have worked their whole lives in like the service industry go into like a boot camp or go into like a self-learning path and come out making two to three times the amount of money that they were and if being two to three times happier in their role. It's for everyone, but I ended up getting a job as a junior web developer and then from there just improving my skills and I made 17 an hour? It was like 30,000 a year. Amazing, and if you don't mind sharing a range of how much do you make now? Yeah, I make around 250,000 a year. - Amazing, that's good. This next developer is among the highest paid developers on earth. And this is how we got here. What's up guys? I'm here with Matthew. Tell us a little bit about yourself. I am a developer at Credit Karma. I have been for the past four-ish years, since like 2018. Right, we have a lot of developers when they look at the job posting it says like, "Hey, we need like one year to five years of experience." So like, what would be your advice for that? Even if it doesn't... If I don't have the years of experience, if I don't meet every single qualification, I would say go for it. Like the worst that can happen is they say no. Awesome. Okay and when you got your first job as a developer, How much did you make? Right out of college I was working at a company called Axture and I was offered 80k a year. I switched because I realized that I wasn't growing the way I needed to, I wasn't learning new technologies. Yeah, I also do believe that the quickest way to like get raises in salary is to keep looking, keep switching. So yeah, I found Credit Karma, I think through a referral, which I would say is very important. Like those online applications are... Those are like such a numbers game that I think you're way better off seeing if you can even just like find someone on LinkedIn and like ask them to just look at your resume. I think that's going to get you way further. This is all amazing advice. Now, how much do you make as developer now? Now, I would say so I'm a senior software engineer now at Credit Karma. The total comp I think adjusted for like the growth in stock would be over 400,000 annually. Amazing, dude. Let's go. Yeah, let's go. You thought that was awesome. and you thought, man, I want to learn software development. I want to make money with coding. Well, guess what? Me and my team are helping students do just that. Tons of students like Allie here, Frank Ramos, Devin Gray, and many others. If you want to get results like that and you want to work with us, me and my team, click the link below and apply.

## Transcription

In this video, I'm gonna show you how I learned to code from scratch in just one year. I'm gonna show you the exact path, learning resources, tools, and most importantly, the learning hacks that I used to go from a complete beginner to a self-taught programmer, building and shipping complex apps and workflows that are now used by thousands of people. So you can do the same thing if you want to, or maybe even get a job as a programmer if that's a goal you have. We're also gonna talk about two secret weapons that I use both to learn faster and to build and ship things much more quickly as well. And one of those has even become a surprisingly good source of side income for me. I think represents a pretty interesting side hustle opportunity, even for people who are not expert level coders. But I'll talk about that later on in the video. First, here's an outline of everything we're gonna cover here. I'm gonna try to make this as comprehensive as possible so it's a jumping off point that you can use if you wanna learn how to code. And we're gonna talk about how I picked my language, how I got started, the exact learning resources that I used, all of which are completely free by the way. We're gonna talk about those two secret weapons I mentioned. a few learning hacks I use to learn even faster, and some of my favorite programming tools. Feel free to skip around this video all you like. I have timestamps in the description down below. We're gonna start off with a bit of a discussion on how I got started and how I chose my programming language because one of the most common questions people have when they wanna learn how to code is what language should I start with? So personally, I started with JavaScript and I focused specifically on what's called backend programming. And backend programming has to do with everything that happens sort of under the hood or behind the scenes. Whereas front-end programming has to do with the actual interfaces and controls that you actually interact with on websites and apps. So think of back-end coding kind of like designing or building a car engine. Whereas front-end coding would be like designing the car body itself, but also the controls like the steering wheel or the ejector seat button. So for example, my favorite project that I built so far, also vastly the most complex project I built so far, is called Notion Voice Notes. And it's a few thousand lines of code that essentially take an audio file, like a lecture recording or a voice note or a podcast, transcribes it to text, summarizes that text with AI into lists like the main points and the action items, and then creates a brand new page in my Notion note-taking system with all of that detail. So I can basically take notes with my voice. And to interact with that system, all I have to do is upload an audio file to Google Drive, and then everything happens automatically in the background. That's what I mean by back-end coding. And I'm telling this story because that workflow, taking notes with my voice, is actually one of the primary inspirations I had to learn how to code in the first place. I have wanted to be able to take notes with my voice for years. I go for a lot of long walks and I've always wished I could just record a voice note and then get like a perfect transcription later on that I could read through, skim, add highlights to, all that good stuff. And then literally in the airport on the way to my honeymoon after getting married last year, I came across a blog post in line for coffee by somebody who was using JavaScript and a few other free tools to transcribe podcast episodes to text. And as I was scrolling through that blog post, I couldn't understand any of the code in it at the time, but I was confident that if I could come to learn enough JavaScript to understand that code, I would be able to modify it and I would be able to build my voice note taking workflow. So the choice for me was clear. I needed to learn JavaScript. There was another reason as well. I wanted to send my notes to Notion and the Notion API is primarily use the JavaScript. That made the choice clear for me. And if you're watching this, if you're confused about what language you should start with, note that I'm not telling you you should start with JavaScript, but I am telling you you should start with the same kind of inspiration. You should pick a language that will let you build something that is interesting to you personally. Because at the end of the day, programming languages are just tools. So if you're just saying, I want to learn how to code, it's kind of like saying, I want to learn how to use a hammer. And yeah, I can get a loose piece of two by four and have some nails sticking out of it. I can teach you how to swing a hammer, but you're going to have a lot more success if you start with something that you actually want to build. Like I want to build a house or I want to build a computer because once you have the project in mind, you're going to know what tools you actually need for it. So once you understand the project, you're going to understand what tool you should pick, but you're also going to learn a lot faster for a couple of different reasons. First, having a goal in mind, having something that you're interested to build is going to focus your attention because programming languages are full of tons of different sub skills and methods and classes. And you kind of have to know which ones to learn and focus on at first. Otherwise, you're going to be very, very scatterbrained. The other thing, the more important thing is when you have an end goal in mind, your brain is going to understand that what you're learning, even if it's kind of boring in the moment or on its own. is relevant to something you care about. So it's going to be stickier. You're going to retain it much more easily. Now, there are some other factors that go into language selection, like the popularity of the language, how competitive it is in the job market if you are trying to get a job as a programmer, the difficulty of learning language in general. And there's a whole great post on FreeCodeCamp's website that goes through these considerations and talks about them. I'll link to that in the description below. But the really nice thing about starting with a language that's going to help you build something interesting in the short term, is once you learn that language, if you have to learn a second language in the future, it's going to be much. much, much easier. And the reason for that is that we can break programming down into two general categories of subskills. We have language-specific subskills, so things like the syntax of the language, its quirks, maybe the frameworks or tools that you use to work with that language. But then we have a much bigger category of universal programming skills, so things like data structures, working with functions, just the logical practice of solving problems with code. And once you kind of hone your skills in this category with your first language, you take those skills into your second language and all you have to do is kind of apply them to the syntax and the quirks of the new language. So learning a new language, if you have to for a job or anything else is gonna go way, way, way faster than learning your first language. And speaking of learning, let's now talk about the learning resources that I use to learn JavaScript. So the main one that I'm going to recommend for anybody who does want to learn JavaScript, which I think is a great first choice if you are interested in building web apps or doing backend programming like I do or building websites, is this JavaScript algorithms and data structures course on freecodecamp.org. Like I said, everything in this learning resources section is completely free. And as the name in Free Code Camp implies, this is a completely free course. I also think it is absolutely the best beginner resource for anybody trying to learn JavaScript. And the reason for that is there are tons and tons of mini lessons in this course. There's a whole bunch of modules here and every one of them has a bunch of different mini lessons. Each one of those mini lessons is kind of a self-contained challenge. So you're immediately having to write code while you're learning. So for example, we have understanding uninitialized variables right here. It gives you a little bit of a lesson on what it's trying to teach you. And then it immediately asks you to write code and it has a button where you can run tests and see if your code is actually. write or if there's a bug in it. So this immediately gets you writing code instead of just like reading theory or going through a book. And I think that is the best way to learn any programming language, not just JavaScript. If you can get your hands dirty and start coding right away, you're going to learn a lot faster and you're going to be a lot more motivated to keep learning. Now, before I go on to the next learning resource that I want to recommend here, I have two little tips, things that I did with this course that I think are worth mentioning. First and foremost, alongside this course, I had a little test folder in my own programming editor. I use VS Code right here. And basically when I would run across a particularly interesting lesson, I would try to take the lesson and remix it and challenge myself to go do something different with it. So for example, if the lesson was teaching me how to write a really basic for loop where it just prints out one, two, three, four, five, et cetera, I would go into my editor and challenge myself to kind of up the ante a little bit. Instead of going one, two, three, four, five, what if I skipped every third number? or what if I went just the even numbers? And doing that is a great way to take a challenge that's just a tutorial challenge, something that someone else has laid out for you and turn it into something that you have more ownership over and something that you care about more. In business, there's this idea called the Ikea effect where people have more affinity, they're more proud of the furniture they own from Ikea because they had to actually go through the process of building it themselves. This is also applied really successfully in video games like Minecraft. even in software like Notion. I think a big reason people love Notion is they get to build stuff and be proud of it. And when you're learning programming, you can use this concept to your advantage. You can take the tutorials and take the concepts they're trying to teach you, remix them a little bit, and kind of turn it into play almost. The second thing, and this is gonna be kind of controversial that I did here, is I went through, if I go back to the Free Code Camp course, I went through the basic JavaScript module, which is 113 lessons. Then I went through the ES6 module, which is 29. And then I actually quit the course. I didn't go through this regular expressions module, the debugging, I didn't go through any of these because ES6 and basic JavaScript taught me enough to go off and build the thing I wanted to build at the time. I had two kind of main inspirations. The first we already covered, which was me wanting to build a voice notes workflow. The other one is I really wanted to teach the Notion API over my second channel, Thomas Frank Explains. And I had this really fun project idea that I wanted to build. I wanted to make an automated Pokedex generator where it would pull Pokemon from an API and bring them in automagically. And after going through those first two modules, I felt that I had enough knowledge and I had enough tools in my tool belt to go off and start building that. I also had enough knowledge to now go out and look through references, look through kind of like reference resources and figure out things that I didn't know without having to go through a structured course. So one thing that I would recommend that you follow, something that I do all the time, is no matter what kind of educational resource you're going through, don't feel that you have to complete it 100% before you can go off and try doing your own stuff. Instead, think of the educational resource as a reference. Maybe you need to go through the first few modules to sort of just get your feet wet and understand the basic language of the skill you're learning. But then if you get inspiration, if you get inspiration, If you want to go build something, don't feel that you have to complete the entire course before you can go do that. Let the inspiration carry you. Okay, so I went through the JavaScript algorithms and data structures course. That is the main resource I would recommend here. The next one is the modern JavaScript tutorial, which you can find over at javascript.info. So this I think is a great compliment to that free CodeCamp course because where that one is a little bit light on explanation and heavy on exercises and actual coding, this is the exact opposite. So let's say I search for arrays here. I think they'll probably have an article on arrays within this. Here it is. This is basically a really well-written online free book that basically can teach you everything that the other course isn't teaching you. So if you're going through an exercise in the course and you wanna kind of understand the concept that's teaching a bit more, the Modern JavaScript Tutorial is my number one resource recommendation for going through it. There's also an actual reference guide, which I'm gonna cover next, but I think the modern JavaScript tutorial is a bit easier to read. It's a bit more fun to read. So consider that to be an important tool in your programming, especially JavaScript focused tool belt. And the third one that I'm gonna mention, which I think makes up the trifecta of the ultimate JavaScript learning resources, in my opinion, is the MDN web docs. So these are basically like the de facto official documentation for JavaScript for a lot of web technologies actually. but they have this whole JavaScript kind of guide you can go through. I think you could actually learn JavaScript going through just this website, but the real strength here is any sort of function that you're trying to use or piece of language you're trying to understand, there is comprehensive documentation on it on this website. So for example, there is a function I use all the time called map, and right here, array prototype map, they have a whole article on it. They have a demo, they have syntax, they have parameters, and most importantly, they have examples right here. So if you wanna understand how to use a function like this, you would go to the MDN web docs. And for that reason, I would recommend keeping this in particular as a bookmark resource on your computer. A couple others that are worth mentioning. First, there is a weird JavaScript course by Fireship on YouTube, which I think is really, really fun. It's kind of like a high level overview of JavaScript and all of these videos are super entertaining to watch. Highly recommend watching those and also just subscribing to Fireship in general. He has some of the best programming content on YouTube. And then the last learning resource I wanna talk about here isn't anything in particular, it's more of a general recommendation to kind of just let yourself get obsessed with coding. If you feel the interest, just sort of like start learning by osmosis. So this is something that I definitely did as I was watching through videos like Fireships here on YouTube, I started to notice that my recommendations had more and more stuff about JavaScript. And so a lot of times if I was like eating dinner or lunch or something, Instead of going to Netflix or watching a movie, I would watch programming content on YouTube instead and just sort of learn by osmosis. For example, when I was going through this Fireship course, my YouTube algorithm took notice and started recommending me lots and lots of JavaScript-related content on my home feed. One of those videos was this video right here on What the Heck is the Event Loop Anyway by Philip Roberts, and I just watched that while eating dinner one night, and now I have a much better understanding of how asynchronous code works in JavaScript. I probably wouldn't have even thought to look that up in the first place, but it was just recommended to me and I watched it and I'm really glad that I did. Okay, so it's now time to go into secret weapon number one in this video. And that secret weapon is ChatGPT, but probably not in the way that you think. Because a lot of people, especially a lot of people that I follow on Twitter that end up in my feed, will say ChatGPT can write code for you. We have GitHub Copilot, which uses ChatGPT to basically generate code on the fly. And if you're already a professional programmer, that could be a great way to boost your productivity. But if you're trying to learn how to code, letting ChatGPT write code for you is actually a bad idea because you are not going to come to understand how that code is actually working. You have to write it yourself. So what I did instead was I used ChatGPT as a learning tool, and I came to discover that it has two major strengths that the courses and reference materials that I was using primarily kind of lack. The first one is that ChatGPT can tailor the level of the material that it's generating for you on the fly. to your specific needs. Something like a course or a reference guide can't do that because it's written for lots and lots of people. Whereas with ChatGPT, you can say, hey, I didn't quite understand that. Could you give me some more examples? Could you bring this down to say like a 10th grade level, something like that? So for example, I have one piece of history here where I was asking, what is a set? Can you teach me about it? And how running the has function in it is more efficient than some alternative. I can't remember what the context was, but here it basically generates a mini article for me. and if this wasn't enough, I could ask for more examples or more guidance just to make sure that my understanding was clear. The other thing that I've learned with ChatGPT is it is fantastic for eliminating what's called a second order incompetence, which are basically the things that you don't Don't know that you don't know. Literally the stuff in a skill that you just don't even know exists yet. And I found that if you prompt it right, ChatGPT is really good at helping you discover these kinds of things. So just to give you an example here, here's one of the prompts I gave it. I gave it a function that I wrote myself, and I said, here's a function I wrote that fetches Pokemon from the PokeAPI, creates an array of objects with their data. You don't have to worry about what this code does in this video. This isn't a technical level video, but this is key. How would a senior JS developer improve this code. And then I said, for each suggested improvement, please explain why you've suggested it as if I'm a student unaware of it. So I pasted my code below the prompt here as context. And then it gives me a whole list of suggestions here. Use promise.all for concurrent requests, refactor error handling, separation of concerns. And a lot of these concepts, the first time that I wrote a prompt like this, I had no idea existed. For example, this concurrent requests suggestion here, I didn't know... what that was. And it turned out to be one of the most useful concepts I ever learned as a programmer. And I'll just take a little bit of an aside here to explain it. So a lot of what I do with my programming is I write code that reaches out to APIs and then gets responses. So for example, if I want to get a Pokemon from the Poke API, I have to make a request and then I have to get the response. So if I wanted to get say a hundred Pokemon, I might write a loop, which is one of the first things you learn about as a programmer, and it would do it as many times as as needed. reach out, get the response, then kick off the next iteration, reach out, get the response, and do that a hundred times. When I learned about concurrency, I learned that you can basically write code that will reach out and it doesn't have to actually wait to get the response before it will send the next request. And just to show you an example of how powerful this is, over on a platform called Pipe Dream, which spoilers is my next secret weapon, but I'm going to show you here. I wrote some code to show just how much faster concurrency can be. than what's called serial programming, where we're just waiting for the response before we kick off the next iteration of our loop here. So I wrote some code that grabs the first 50 Pokemon, both in serial and using concurrent code. And we can see here to get these 50 Pokemon names, with serial calls, it took seven seconds or 7,000 milliseconds here, whereas the concurrent calls doing the exact same thing only took 530 milliseconds, just over half a second. So we get this massive speed increase just by implementing concurrency. And again, I didn't know about that at all. I didn't know it existed as a concept until I asked that magic question. How would a senior JavaScript developer improve this code? And then please explain the suggested improvements. Now I could probably do a whole video in the future on ChatGPT. I've used it for a lot more beyond coding. What I will say to wrap up this section is still realize that ChatGPT can get things wrong. So it is really important not to lean entirely on ChatGPT as a teaching tool. I truly believe you should go through courses and get very familiar with the official documentation at the MDN web docs, and then use ChatGPT as a support tool that supports those official resources. That brings us to secret weapon number two, which I've already showed you a little bit in this video, but the tool is called PipeDream. And it's kind of like Zapier or Make.com. It's like a no-code automation tool that allows you to sort of hook up different tools together. But the real difference between Pipe Dream and something like Zapier is Pipe Dream makes it super easy to write JavaScript code that can actually support your workflows. And you can even bring in packages that make your code even more powerful. And the reason that I'm listing this as a secret weapon is I have found PipeDream allows me to build and ship really useful workflows incredibly quickly. And that actually encourages me to go off and do it. One of the biggest blockers that kept me from learning programming for a very long time was all the infrastructure and all the extra stuff around the actual code that you want to write. Because traditionally, if you want to ship an app, you got to write your code for the app, but you also have to get servers. You have to think about authentication. You have to think about OAuth for APIs and all kinds of stuff like that. And the beautiful thing about PipeDream is it's a platform that basically takes care of all of that for you. So if you're like me and you're very focused on backend programming, where you're sort of like building little machines that automate work between different tools, PipeDream makes that incredibly fast. And I want to show you an example in this video just to show you how powerful this tool can actually be. So here I have a very simple workflow setup, which is called audio to Notion. This is basically the exact same thing I talked about in the intro where we are uploading an audio file to Google Drive and then we're transcribing it and sending the transcript to Notion. And currently I'm using only no code components. So we have a trigger here. It's going to then download the file to what's called temp storage. We're going to connect with OpenAI to transcribe the audio file to text. And then we're going to create a brand new page in a note taking system in Notion that has that transcript. So here I've got that note taking system. I'm just calling it voice notes. And if I go ahead and test this workflow right here, we get a success message after a couple of seconds. And if I go back over to Notion, we see voice sample.mp3. I can open that up and you can see we have a full transcript of an audio file that I recorded. And you could do this in a traditional no-code automation builder like Zapier or Make.com, but there's one problem that I see with this transcript. It's a wall of text. There's just so many lines of text here. I would love if this was broken up into paragraphs, but unfortunately, the no-code components in PipeDream don't have an option to do that. So that is where adding code into the mix. becomes really, really useful. And the way we can do that in PipeDream is just by adding a step and choosing the node step right here. So node.js, if you don't know about it, is what's called a backend runtime for JavaScript. It basically lets you run JavaScript outside of just the browser. You can run it on servers, almost like a true backend language like PHP. And here we can use it to basically write code that acts as glue to do extra stuff within our workflows in PipeDream. So I'm just gonna grab a hello world component right here. and I've prepared some. code that I'm just going to copy and paste directly into this step. Again, this is not meant to be a technical video, so you don't have to worry about what this code is doing or how it works. But basically we're importing a really powerful library called natural, which can split our transcript into sentences. And then I have some simple code here that is going to basically make groups of two sentences per paragraph. So if I test this out, you can see what it does. And you can see here on the return value area, we now have our transcript, but we have some line breaks. between these groups of paragraphs. So if I copy this path here, and I come down into our create page from database, no code action, and I basically replace this page content call with that variable, we can test it one more time. And once again, we get a success message. We can go back over to Notion, and now we can check out this brand new page. And would you look at that? We have actual paragraphs, and each paragraph is an individual block inside of Notion. So that is really what code can allow you to do. Once you kind of come up against the limits of no-code platforms, a platform like PipeDream basically says, hey, write your own code, work around those limitations, and you can build a workflow that does pretty much exactly what you want. So I started using PipeDream in that capacity. I was building no-code workflows and then adding little, little snippets of code just to sort of add things that I wanted. And over time, I got more and more involved in the platform to the point now where my Notion Voice Notes automation actually works on PipeDream. That is where it lives. but it is entirely based on code. Nothing is using a no-code component at this point. And I wrote probably 2,500 lines of code over several months to make this entire thing work. And that's actually the reason that I am listing Pipedream in this video, even if you are not a backend-focused developer, because it represents a concept that I think is very important for learning how to code, and that is the removal of friction. Like I said before, I was originally intimidated by all the extra stuff you have to do around coding, like authentication, security, servers. Finding a platform like Pipedream basically gave me a tool where I could just write simple code, write the code that I knew how to write, and get something that actually worked and did something interesting. And that gave me enough momentum. It gave me a result that pushed me to keep improving my scripts until eventually I was coding entirely code-based scripts that weren't using no-code components. And now I'm to the point where I actually do understand things like authentication and servers. So if I wanted to go ahead and turn this into a non-PipeDream-based workflow, if I wanted to build a full stack app on it, I'm now much better equipped to do that. And I don't think I would have gotten to that point quite as quickly without an interim tool like PipeDream. Now in the intro, I also mentioned that one of those secret weapons has become a source of side income for me and represents a pretty interesting side hustle opportunity. That actually is PipeDream as well. And I wanna show you exactly why. So first and foremost, PipeDream has a feature that a lot of other no-code tools do not have that I think is super useful. And that is this little share link feature right here. Essentially, I can create this, I can choose some settings and I can generate a little link that when anyone clicks it, it's going to automatically rebuild this entire workflow in their PipeDream account. So it's almost like a Notion template. And the other thing PipeDream has is an affiliate program. and a pretty darn good one at that because when people click through and actually upgrade to a paid account, the affiliate gets 33% of their payments for an entire year. Now, Pipe Dream is also incredibly powerful on its free tier. So I've been working with their affiliate program for the past few months, and I think only 1% of the people who have clicked my affiliate link have actually converted to a paid account. But just that 1% of people, about 100 customers so far, has generated $4,000 in commissions over the past few months. And that number is only growing every single month. So it's this really cool thing that I get to do where I get to basically build free software, share it with my audience, which I mainly do over on my second channel, Thomas Frank Explains, and a small portion of the people who use that software eventually upgrade to paid accounts, maybe their teams, or just have a lot of automation needs. And I'm able to- earn some income that way without having to actually sell anything. But if you're following along, you might be getting an idea here because these share links are kind of like notion templates in a way. They're just links that kind of help you duplicate something that I've built. And if you've been following me on Twitter, you might know that a large part of my business these days is selling paid notion templates over my website. Well, I think you could do the exact same thing with PipeDream, you could either build bespoke workflows for clients. In fact, I've done that for Nebula, or you could build workflow templates like the Notion Voice Notes template that I made or Notion Voice Tasks template that I made, and you can actually sell those as useful paid software. I don't have the capacity to do that right now because I would want to offer support for it. It's just one of my values, but I think somebody who had a bit more time and a little bit of programming skill could really deliver value by putting together workflows in PipeDream and then selling them. So keep that in mind as a potential source of side income. At this point in the video, we are now going to move on to the next section, which is three of my top learning hacks for learning programming even faster. The first one is the simplest, write code often. Write code as much as you can. And I'm saying this explicitly because a lot of people, when they try to learn programming, get caught up in tutorials and they get caught up in watching learning materials. That's important. But it's much more important that you actually go write code and try to build things. And anything you can do to make the process of writing code easier for yourself, anything you can do to remove friction from that process, you should do. It is one of the main reasons I chose to feature PipeDream so prominently in this video because it's the tool that allows me to just spin up useful workflows really quickly, where otherwise I might say, oh, that's too much of a hassle right now. I'm too busy. I'm not going to do it. For example, a few months ago, I was on a Discord with some people and one person was like, Okay. Man, I really wish I could pull Magic the Gathering card art into my Notion database. And I was like, there's a Magic the Gathering API. It's called the Scryfall API. I think I could whip up something really quickly in Pipe Dream that would pull the cards this person wants from Scryfall and put them into Notion. So I built that in just about 20 minutes using Pipe Dream, gave them the share link, and they were able to use it. And I learned a whole bunch of cool code tricks along the way because it was a new and novel challenge. if I didn't have a tool like Pipedream. I might not have taken that on because I only had about an hour of time worth in that evening to do it. And I will recommend another tool aside from PipeDream for this purpose, and that's called Replit. So PipeDream is really about building automations between APIs. Replit is actually almost like a full coding platform in the cloud. You can write code in tons of different languages. You can actually run that code. You can deploy full apps. I've used it. I've even embedded. some Replit embeds in some of my coding tutorials on my blog, and you can literally run code in them. So definitely check that out because it's yet another platform that will allow you to spin up something very quickly. And again, it removes that friction from the process of trying something out or starting a quick project. Learning hack number two is once you start building projects that get pretty sizable, you wanna have a testing folder aside from that project where you can write specific functions in isolation and test them. And I wanna show you kind of an example here So once again, to jog your memory, this is my biggest project. It's called Notion Voice Notes, and it is absolutely massive. Now, typically, you probably wouldn't write code files this long in normal modern projects that use modern design patterns. My code is in one gigantic file here because I started on Pipe Dream, and initially, I was writing in the actual Pipe Dream app where you kind of have to have everything in one file. So I could split this up, but still, this is a gigantic project, and it has a lot of moving parts. And if I want to test something in the middle of the project, then the testing process can get really, really tedious and lengthy because it's sort of like handing stuff off to other functions. So instead, once you get a project around this size, maybe even a little smaller, you want to give yourself like a testing folder here. And this will essentially allow you to write small functions and then test them out directly to make sure they work before you plug them in to your bigger project. So here I have a very small function that is going to take. a list of Pokemon objects, and I can sort them by a specific criteria. So down here, just to point this out, I'm sorting my Pokemon object by their type. And if I run this code, I get an error, and it says type is not defined. This is an example of quick iteration. Here, I can immediately get my error, whereas if I was writing this function in my giant project, I would have to go through this entire build process, and it would take me a lot longer to get this exact error message. So here, I get it right away. I can go, whoops. I accidentally forgot to put my quotation marks around this word type here. Let's go ahead and save the file. Let's run the code again. And do we get an error message this time? No, we don't. And we do see that we have our Pokemon objects sorted in reverse order by their type, water, grass, and fire. So again, give yourself a little test area where you can write functions in isolation and you're going to... tighten those feedback loops and make much quicker progress. And speaking of progress, learning hack number three is to build yourself a code snippets note or maybe even a code snippets database. So I wanna show you mine really quickly here to show you what this is. Here in my note-taking system in Notion, I've got a note called code snippets. And basically, whenever I find myself using a snippet of code all the time in my projects, I will create a snippet for it in this note. So I've got one here. This one's kind of verbatious. I don't know if that's a word, but I'm gonna come down here to show you this one. import the Notion SDK into PipeDream. So basically, if I wanna work with the Notion API, there is this import statement, and then there's some specific code for creating an instance of a client that I can use to work with the Notion API. I often forget how to actually type this out, and that's kind of okay, because memorizing coding syntax, specifically for libraries here, is probably one of the least valuable skills you can have as a programmer, especially as AI starts to become more and more part of our workflow. It's much more important to understand the logic and the creative problem solving process. So here, if I need to import the Notion SDK into PipeDream, I'm just gonna come grab my snippet, I'm gonna paste it in, and then I'm gonna start coding from this base. And that is going to allow me to code much more quickly and spend a lot less time trying to remember, hey, how do I do this thing that I've done a million times before? It's all about efficiency. Speaking of efficiency, I wanna now talk about some of my favorite programming tools that speed up my workflow and basically make work a lot easier as well. First one is what's called VS Code or Visual Studio Code. This is an editor, and there are a lot of editors out there. There's like Sublime Text, there's like Notepad++ if you're really old school, but VS Code is kind of seen as one of the most popular, one of the most powerful out there. It's the one that I use, and for basically any programming language that you're working in, you can probably use VS Code. And in particular, I want to point out a few different extensions that you can actually add to VS Code to make it really powerful as a learning tool. So here in VS Code, which is free, it's on basically all the major systems, I can open up my little extensions area and you can see that I have five installed. CodeRunner is the number one extension that I would recommend installing. I think you also need to install node.js, which is pretty easy. You can just go to the website, which I'll link below, install that in your computer. And the reason I love CodeRunner so much is it lets you run code really, really quickly. I've already shown it in this video, but I'll show it one more time. Basically, if I clear the output here in the output tab, and If I just right click and hit run code, it runs the code and I can see the results and I can see any errors if it's going to throw an error. So this is the fastest way to just run a snippet of code, get an answer and tighten those feedback loops. There's another extension that does a very similar thing. It is called live preview. And this one, instead of basically outputting the results of your code in this little output tab here, actually creates like a mini browser window inside of VS Code. So this can be very helpful if you're actually writing HTML around your JavaScript. So just like before, I have this very simple HTML file, but we have this Pokemon sorting function that I've built here. And if I just click this little preview button right here, I can actually see what the table is going to look like inside of a mini browser window. And the cool thing about this extension is it will automatically update if I change the code. So let's say I come down here and I change my sorting criteria from attack to let's say name. Now we can see it is sorting by name in reverse order. If I remove this reverse call here, now it's sorting in alphabetical order, ascending order. And again, this is just a super quick way to iterate on your code, make changes, and actually see the results in real time. Another extension that I highly recommend that is a great learning tool is called Quokka, quokka.js right here. This will basically execute code directly inside of your editor on a line-by-line basis. So to show you an example of that, I got this loop test.js file here. It's doing something very, very simple. It's just doing a 99 loop here. Then it's basically just printing 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 98, 97, et cetera. And you can see here, Quokka actually will output the result of this console log statement in the editor itself. This is a great way to learn. And to show you a very, very simple example, just to drive it home, let's do something super duper easy. We'll do console.log two times two. And you can see immediately it goes four, so you can see exactly what's happening. Maybe if we use a division operator, we'll get one. And again, this just teaches you in the moment what your code is actually doing. A couple more extensions before we move on to some other tools. I really like ESLint, which is just this great extension that basically adds what's called linting to your JavaScript. It will basically change the colors. It'll highlight errors, things like that. And then we also have Prettier, which is a formatter that will basically just format your code with indentations and line breaks as needed. I love that. Okay, a few more tools beyond VS Code that I wanna recommend here. First one is called DevUtils. This is a macOS app that basically just has a huge toolbox of little utilities that come in real- handy when you're programming. So for example, there's like a JSON validator and formatter. There's a text difference checker. There is like a regex tester, I believe. There's all kinds of really, really useful utilities that before I was using devutils, I would often have to Google for. So if you are in a Mac, check that out. If there is a Windows alternative, I will link to it in the description. I'm not aware of one right now. Another really useful one is called Recbin. This is just a website that allows you to send API requests or send a post or get requests to APIs. I use this all the time when I'm building pipe dream workflows, just a really easy way to send those requests without needing like a special piece of software for it. So I recommend that. And then I also recommend, of course, GitHub. GitHub is probably something every programmer should get familiar with, or at least some kind of what's called version control system. So basically I can write code on my computer. I can commit it to what's called a repository or repo. And here on GitHub, this is an example of a repo. I have my notion voice notes. mjs file it's a javascript file just with an m in front of it for i believe it's module and i can go into the history of this file and for any given commit i can literally see what was changed and what was added so all of these lines here were added in this commit these lines in red were deleted and replaced with these lines here so if there's like a screw up or you're working with collaborators and they need to understand what has changed about a piece of code That's what version control is really, really good for. And I would highly recommend learning at least a little bit about GitHub and how to use it if you are getting into programming. Okay, I want to share one more tool with you in this video. And it's actually a tool that you might find useful even outside of programming. So earlier, I showed you my code snippets page inside of my Notion note-taking database. And that notes page is inside a greater system that I built for myself called Ultimate Brain, which is an entire productivity system inside of Notion. A few years ago, I got really tired of juggling all kinds of productivity apps. I had a note-taking app, I had a to-do list app, I had another task management app for my team, and I eventually got to the point where I just wished everything could be in one place. And when I found Notion, I started to realize that I think I could build a system that would accomplish that goal inside of Notion. So I spent months tinkering, experimenting, learning how to use the tool, and eventually I was able to build a system where I have my tasks, my notes, my goal tracking, my project management, everything I need. to organize my day-to-day life is now inside of Notion, inside of a system I built called Ultimate Brain. And in particular, my favorite part of the system is the project manager that I built because for any given project, I can see both the tasks for that project and the notes for that project all on one page. And I find that super helpful because I'm often creating tasks as part of a project using the context from those notes. And in addition to just using this myself, I also released it as a product last year. And since then, over 25,000 people have bought it. And my team and I have collected dozens and dozens of testimonials from people who find it just as useful as I do. Now, you probably know if you've been watching this channel for quite a while that traditionally we've always relied on brand deals and sponsorships as our main source of income. And that's been great. But I have to say, being able to build something that is both useful for me and for my audience is even better, especially since we're not just selling a Notion template, We also include access to an active support community where you can not only get answers to every single question you have, but you can also swap tips with other people on how to improve your template, add additions to it, customize it, and improve your overall productivity system and your workflow. And if you haven't already picked up your own copy of Ultimate Brain, now is actually the best time to do it because we are running our first ever Black Friday sale. For the rest of this month, you can get Ultimate Brain at a huge discount, 50% off by going over to thomasjfrank.com slash brain using the code blackfriday23 at checkout. Now, you might be asking yourself, why is Tom running a Black Friday deal? He's never done it before. It's a valid question, but in this instance, we actually have a very good reason for doing it. And that reason is we're actually building another tool that's going to make both Ultimate Brain even better, but also Notion better for anybody who uses it. That tool is called Flylighter, and it is going to be the ultimate web clipper and idea capture tool for Notion. It is a great tool that's gonna help you capture screenshots, highlights, add annotations to those highlights. Basically, it is the idea and knowledge capture tool that I have always wanted. And the thing is, we wanna build this sustainably. We wanna build it in a bootstrapped way and we don't wanna take VC money. I actually already have VCs in my inbox asking about this, but I think that if we took VC money, we would eventually be forced or at least pressured into making decisions that weren't aligned with what you actually want. So instead, what I would love to do is be able to use the products we already sell as a way to self-fund the building of this new tool and allow us to have a great free tier in addition to the premium features that we're planning. So that is what Ultimate Brain allows us to do right now. And there's also a ton of synergy here because Ultimate Brain is already the best organizational and productivity system for Notion. And Flylighter is going to basically make the capture part of that system even better. So if you want to help us build this tool, you want to also supercharge your productivity and get the best organizational system for Notion. Second brain for notion, you can go over to thomasjfrank.com slash brain. And again, use that code black Friday, 23 at checkout to get 50% off of any edition of the template. You can pick up the standalone edition, or if you're a creator, you can also get the ultimate brain plus creators companion bundle. And that also gets you the exact system that my team and I use to manage all the content on this channel on Thomas Frank explains on Twitter on basically all the places where I put out content onto the internet. If you're a serious content creator, and you want to put out more. more and better content, I think you're going to love Creators Companion as well. So once again, you can go over to thomasjfrank.com slash brain and use that code blackfriday23 at checkout to get 50% off of either edition of the template. And with that ad read over, because it's kind of an ad read, but it's my product, to wrap this video up, seriously, I want to say thank you. Because not only do I get to make this kind of content for a living, but now it's so cool. I get to make a literal startup for a living. And I feel like there's a way forward where we don't have to take VC money to literally build this really cool piece of tech. And that's all thanks to you. I've been putting out content for 10 years, but if you weren't watching it, then we wouldn't be able to do any of this. So seriously, if you've bought one of my products, if you've supported us on Nebula, if you have supported my sponsors, or even just watched this content and helped boost it in the algorithm, thank you. We would not be able to do this without you. Seriously, I appreciate you so much. To wrap this video up, because this is a coding focused video, I have a couple of different resources that I want to point you to. First and foremost, if you want a project that kind of just like takes everything I've covered in this video and shoves it into something you can actually do. My Notion API Pokedex project is something you might wanna go through. It's a two-hour video, and there's also a written version of it that links to literally all the resources I talked about in this video. Secondly, if you do wanna learn to code, then learning how to learn more efficiently is going to help you in your journey, and that video right there will help you with that as well. Thanks as always for watching, and I will see you in the next one.

## Transcription

So originally I was going to make a video about all the ways that you can make money by learning how to code. After I did a little bit of research on the topic, I realized that there are a ton of YouTubers out there that have already made these videos. Pretty much all saying the same thing. So I want to talk about some of those things that they mention in their videos. Instead of just selling you the pipe dream that all of this stuff will be really easy just because you learned how to print Hello World, I'm going to try to keep it real and let you know some of the pitfalls and struggles that you might face with these methods that a lot of people are mentioning that can make you money by learning how to code or becoming a programmer. The main reason why a lot of people want to learn how to code is because they want to get a job as a software developer. And while it seems like an awesome job where you have kombucha on tap and you get to hang out with your hipster colleagues in your dog-friendly office... In Pakistan, dogs are not pets, okay? They're vicious beasts and they chase you down the street. and they bite you. And even though you might have an awesome break room with ping pong tables and video games with endless beverages to choose from, the other thing that will be endless is the features that you'll be implementing and the bugs you'll be fixing and the code that you'll be pushing on a daily basis. And yes, it's true, there are plenty of software engineering jobs with high paying salaries and great benefits, but the truth is that this is a really hard job and burnout is a real thing that many developers go through. There's a reason why the average tenure of a developer at a regular company is usually like two years and fan companies developers really only stick around for about three years the fact that finding a new job is usually the best way to get a raise might play into those numbers what are you looking for a raise get out but there's also a lot of other things that go into that and like i mentioned burnout is real and people burn out at this job a lot it can be demanding at times you have deadlines and you have a lot of stuff that People leave out of... these day in the life videos that can be very stressful and that's why software developers get paid so much. So even though a lot of us tech influencers try to make this job to be super sexy because we have nice offices and we make a ton of money doing it, it's not to say that it's an easy job and it's going to be an easy $100,000 a year. And when you're first starting out, you're going to be lucky to make $50,000, $60,000, maybe $70,000 a year. Right now I have five years of experience And I won't even consider a job that pays less than $120 a year. But the truth is my first job paid me $50,000 a year. While getting a programming job is possible and learning how to code can get you there, it's going to take you a while to make the big money that everyone always talks about. And it's going to be a grind. Even after you get your first job, you're going to have to work your way up to that salary. You have to deal with a lot of corporate bullshit. You have to deal with a lot of nonsense that people don't want to deal with. And working a desk job and being told what you need to do all day and having to meet deadlines, having to deal with middle management, having to deal with business. and just everything that goes into being a developer that doesn't have to do with code can kind of wear on you after a while. And depending on your office politics and your company culture, it can be toxic in most places. And from what I've noticed, a lot of companies are like that. Smaller companies and larger companies alike. They all have their own level of toxicity. And with working from home, which is one of the big benefits that many people always highlight about software development jobs, that's a little bit easier. While this is a great job that you can have remote benefits for or a few work from home days, the truth is most companies still want to keep us in the office. And many of those perks that they try to highlight aren't that great. Because really, at the end of the day, you're sitting in front of your computer, you're writing code, dealing with office work. And it's not as fun and exciting as so many people try to make it out to be on social media. There's a lot of stuff that people don't tell you when they're highlighting all the perks and benefits and pay of this job. So keep that in mind. Because even though it looks awesome on social media, it doesn't necessarily mean that this job is as cool as so many people make it out to be. If you don't like that kind of thing, a programming job might not be the best option for you. But if you're like, I don't want a job, that's not why I'm learning how to code. I wanna learn how to code to be a freelancer. I wanna make my own schedule. I wanna be my own boss. I wanna be a digital nomad and travel the world while I write code and pick up jobs here and there that I want to work and just live that kind of life and beef. free from the corporate world and just dictate my own success by working on freelance projects with clients that I choose to work with. All right, let's talk about freelance. Let's talk about how difficult it actually is to start as a freelancer. Now, if you've got some experience and you've been doing software development for a while now, particularly web dev or even mobile apps and stuff like that, if you have some experience doing those things, then getting freelance work or starting out as a freelancer might be a little bit easier for you because, Because of course people are probably more likely to hire you just because you do have experience. You understand the process, you know how to deliver stuff, and you're probably going to be a better option than someone who doesn't. Now let's say you're that someone who doesn't have any experience at all and you're just learning how to code now and you want to become a freelancer. You can make money as a freelancer. The problem is that becoming a freelancer is really, really hard, even if you do have a ton of experience as a professional developer. Like me, I have almost five years of experience now as a professional web developer, and I have a little bit of freelance experience. With that said, if I tried to go out and start freelancing right now, I'm starting from scratch. I don't have any clients. I might have a few people that I could reach out to, but the truth is that I don't know anyone that will need my services right away. So then what do I have to do? I have to go out and find clients. A lot of people will tell you that the best way to find your first clients is locally. You go to your local mom and pop shop, you go to the bakery, you go to the gym, you go to all these places in your neighborhood or in your town and you start asking them if they need websites or if they need apps, if they need social media stuff, if they need anything that you might be technically savvy enough to help them out with. Now that's a grind all on its own and if you're like me who is kind of an introvert and you hate talking to people and you don't really want to go out and shake hands and kiss babies, you can reach out to your network. If you have one former colleagues, or if you have a little bit of a social media following, if you know anyone, you can just start spreading the word and building websites and stuff for friends and family. And hopefully that will give you a little bit of a freelance portfolio that then you can actually start getting real work from, or those people that you help out and work for free or work for, you know, really cheap. They, they do a little bit of word of mouth for you. And then you start. getting some gigs. But let's say you don't have that. Then you're stuck going to sites like Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer.com and all those other freelancing websites that there are out there. And you are in a sea of applicants. You are going to be racing to the bottom for almost every job that you apply for. And if you don't have a portfolio and if you're not willing to work for practically free until you build that portfolio. you're probably not going to get a call back from someone. And then once you do have a portfolio and you've gotten a little bit of work, you're still competing with so many people out there. And you're also competing with people from different countries who don't need to make as much money as you do to survive. So a lot of the work that you'll find, at least early on, is going to be pretty crappy work and it's not going to pay a lot. Now, let's say you grind it out and you have... Enough savings to do this for a while or you're in a position where you don't need the money right away and you and you put in the work for six months or a year and you build up your clientele and you have some local business and you've got business online freelancers still live pretty hand-in-the-mouth until they're making enough money to where that's not an issue and that can take years just like with the people that learn how to code and get a job in three months there's freelancers out there who do it and in six months are making a ton of money and living the dream life. But those aren't the majority. Those are the minority. Most people are going to be working pretty hard. I've known a lot of people who have been freelance web developers and have been freelance coders. And a lot of them kind of go back to a day job because it can be very stressful living hand to mouth like that. It can be really hard dealing with clients because that whole dream of being able to pick and choose who you work with. Yeah, you might have that freedom, but at the end of the day, if you're going to have someone who's going to pay you good money to do something, and you want that business, and you need that business, because if you don't take that job, you're not going to be able to pay your bills for that month, you're going to have to eat shit, and you're going to have to deal with the clients personally. Because now you're not just dealing with business and middle management, now you're dealing with clients directly. And anyone who's dealt with clients before directly will tell you that clients can be a big pain in the ass. And they can be nitpicky and they can ask you for so much extra stuff and then they try to haggle you on the price and then they try to lowball you or they try not to pay you and it's just, it's a lot of trouble being a freelancer. And if you come into this hearing people talk about how awesome it is to learn how to code and how you can make money as a freelancer and live the dream life of being your own boss, remember that a lot of those people that are telling you that you can be a freelancer doing this have never been freelancers themselves. So if your goal is to be a freelancer, make sure that you're getting your information from people who have actually done it because there's plenty of people out there on YouTube and on social media that will try to sell you that dream and have never done it themselves. Telling people that they can make money makes you a lot of money on the Internet. Let's move on to the next thing. So let's talk about startups, SaaS products, mobile apps, the next social media platform that's going to take the world by storm. Those are all things that people tell you that you can build. It feels like every single software developer I know has some app that they built or some great idea that they started that they are either working on or are no longer working on because they gave it up. The truth about building the next big startup is that startups are highly competitive, especially if you're talking about like hyper growth startups. Of course, you can build a small app idea that maybe solves a problem for you and eventually it grows in the sum. and you get a few users or a few hundred or thousand users and it makes you a nice little bit of money. But if you think you're going to build the next big unicorn startup, the truth is that there's hundreds of thousands of people out there that are working on those same kind of ideas. Probably the same exact idea that you already have. Someone is currently building something for that. And when it comes to creating a startup, the best approach that you can have is to not really care about making money right away because you probably won't make any money right away. It's totally possible. But if you go into it thinking like, I'm gonna make this awesome application that everyone's gonna wanna use, the truth is that there's probably not that many people that need whatever you're building. And there's more of a chance that someone has already built something better. Not trying to be discouraging here. I just want to keep it real when it comes to these things that so many people are telling you are like cool, great, easy, awesome ways to make money with programming. These things aren't easy. None of it is easy. The truth is that it takes a long time. Just like with everything else I'm mentioning in this video. I'm guilty of making videos where I highlight all the cool stuff you can do by learning how to code. And yes, it is cool that you can build your own startup, but it's also super hard and it's not that easy to make money with a startup. Let's talk a little bit about game dev. Similar to startups, a lot of game development starts as a passion project, but many people get into software or want to learn how to code because They want to be. game developers because who doesn't right? I'm a gamer. I played so many video games and the thought of building a game has crossed my mind. The truth is that building a game on your own is really, really difficult. And working as a game developer is one of the worst development jobs I've heard of having. At least if you're working for like a big company, corporations and companies kind of exploit your passion because they know that a lot of game developers are passionate and they want to exploit that because If you work for your passion, you're more likely to work longer hours for less pay. So if you want to get a job as a game developer, I would consider maybe another area of software development. I know there's going to be some people that aren't going to want to hear that, but it's kind of the truth. If you want to create your own video game or your own mobile game or a mod for a video game that you already play, like those things are all great as hobbies and side projects. But if you want to get into this because you want to create your own game, that's going to make you a ton of money. Man, it's hard. It's harder than building a startup. It's probably the hardest path that you can take is to try to become like an indie game developer or the next Wordle or, you know, Flappy Bird developer. There's just so many people doing that stuff. There's just so much crap out there. And if you're coming into this because you really think that you're going to be that much better than everyone out there, then shit, don't let me stop you. Like. I will never want to be the person that steps in the way of your dreams. But if you go into it to make money from creating a video game, it's probably not going to happen. You're going to have to put hours and hours and hours of work into it. And if you're doing it on your own, the chances of you getting that game off the ground and getting it released and making money off of it. Man, try something else. Dude, work on it as a side project and build it up just like you would a startup. And hopefully maybe one day it gets enough players to where you can focus on it full time and maybe get funding and hire more people to help you grow it. But don't think that you're going to make a ton of money being a game developer because it just might not happen. The last thing I want to talk about is content creation, which is a path that I have taken. Just like I learned to code, I went down the path of creating content based around software development. Although I am not doing tutorials, I am more of a... Motivational programming life coach. I couldn't have given myself a cringier title than that. But the truth is that you can make money with content and I'm living proof of it. I share my numbers. I am as transparent as I can be with my audience. I enjoy doing that and I like to show people that you can do these things. Just how I share my story about how I became a software developer. I like sharing my numbers on the stuff I'm doing with content. You can make money with content. In January I made almost five grand. That doesn't include my blog. That doesn't include my affiliate sales. Just off of YouTube ads alone, I made like 4,800 bucks. I think it was. That was my biggest month ever. I mean, the last few months have been the biggest months I've ever had on YouTube. And it's the most money I've made with content ever. I have almost 200 videos uploaded on YouTube and I've been making content for the last two years now. If you're approaching learning how to code and you're getting into content than a blog that you talk about Coding in which would be content that you can create from learning how to code would be an approach that you can take and that's Why I mentioned it in this video, even though my blog doesn't have to do with programming Well, my second blog does but my first blog that's actually making me money doesn't it's it's it's an off-topic blog but you know it's on the web so it requires some knowledge of web development and i have the hosted i set everything up myself and and all of that stuff is is technical skill while it is a wordpress site and you know it doesn't really require any coding knowledge it still i think falls into the same category that it would if if you learn how to code because it is something that would come easier to you you understand how to set up a website and all that stuff. And my YouTube channel has been pretty much all about programming until I went through my midlife crisis a few months ago and started talking about all kinds of different stuff. Most of the content on this channel has been about programming and it has made me money. But if you want to use your coding experience to make money by creating content, then I just want to say that after two years of uploading on YouTube and now I'm currently like trying to build up my Instagram a little bit and I'm trying to build up my Twitter a little bit and I'm really like. going further and further down the rabbit hole of content creation, I am starting to realize that, yes, it is possible to make money with content. And if you know how to code, or if you're learning how to code, you can document your journey, you can create tutorials, you can sell courses, you can write books, you can do so much stuff with the knowledge that you have from coding, and it can make you money. But man, it's a grind. It's a grind just like everything else I've mentioned in this video. And really, that's the main point I'm trying to get across in this video. All the things that can make you money with learning how to code won't come easy. No matter how many videos you see that say easy, fun, exciting ways of making money with programming, blah, blah, blah. There's always going to be somebody out there that's trying to sell you something that's trying to get you to click on their video that's trying to get a view so they can get some ad revenue. I'm one of them. I'm making money off this video, right? But I'm trying to be honest. and I'm trying to let people know that none of this stuff is going to be as easy as a lot of people try to make it seem. It's a grind and it's a lot of work, but it's worth it and it's doable. And if you take anything from this video, just know that if you put in the work and if you put in the time, you can make money from all of these things that I mentioned, but none of it's going to be fast. None of it's going to be easy. It's not really going to be exciting either. And when the grind starts and when you want to continue down the path, because you're determined to do it, you could eventually make money from it one day. Alright, with all that said, thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.

# My Career Advice For Anyone Feeling Stuck In Life

## Transcription

Looking back, I totally wasted my 20s. I had no one in my early 20s speaking anything positive or beneficial to me. When they say to choose your friends wisely, they're not lying. I worked in a restaurant for a few years alongside a part-time radio gig. Then I got married and I stepped up into a data entry role at LapCorp, entering data via a number pad. No, there were no letters. It was just a square number pad. And there was a stack of drug tests, and I just flipped through it and punched in the numbers for eight hours. Then I went on to working in a medical transcription department for the next 10 years. Now, the problem with this approach to life is that if you're ever faced with the unfortunate circumstances of being laid off, you will realize that you are left void of any skill set to move forward with. You don't have any particular place to go after that. If you're in a job that's not specialized and really anyone can do it and you stay there for too long and you move up the ladder, when your days are over there, you have nowhere to go. You have no specific skill set or experience to shift into something later. I didn't go to school for anything particular. I work to jobs that could be replaced easily and when they announced that they were laying off their entire department except my boss and I then I knew my days were numbered. Now in all this my wife was my biggest asset. She kept telling me hey you're fixing everyone's computers in the office you spend a lot of time on computers at home why don't you do some training in computers or programming and she said this multiple times over those years but I worked around very unambitious people eight hours a day and just thought it was impossible. Looking back she was right all along but that's another story. So in those latter years in that job, I started reading, I started studying, I learned to write code, and I got into software development. In the whole story, all of the details are found in this video, so I won't repeat that here. But be sure to go watch that if you're interested. But the turning point for me in coming to the realization that I can move forward with work in computers is largely... based on a diagram that I came across, a diagram that radically changed my mindset on what I should be doing with my life. And when I talk to anyone in a similar situation, especially people in their early 20s who have no clue what to do with their lives, what their calling is, how to make money, how to build a career that's in demand, I now point them to this resource. And I initially came across it in a blog post years ago by Michael Hyatt. And I don't think this blog post exists anymore, but the diagram does. And you may have seen this before, but I'm not sure you've really investigated all of the questions. that this diagram answers. So let me explain it to you. So there are three key items here that help you determine your calling. And all three components have to be here. If not, you'll either hate your job, you'll be broke, or you'll forever be in and out of work. One of those three. And before I explain this, I do wanna mention the launch of my weekly newsletter that kicked off last week. If you're looking for a summary of the latest programming and tech news, AI updates or insights into the latest tech job markets, or you just wanna be an informed developer, be sure to give it a subscribe. I think you'll love it. Link below. So there's three key items here. Listen closely. First, there's passion. Everyone has something they're passionate about. Computers, business, finances, building things, debating, caring for people, whatever it is. Every person has activities that fire them up. It's what excites them. It's what makes them tick. The problem, though, is that passion alone doesn't pay. If I'm passionate about collecting baseball cards, that's great, but it probably won't put me in any successful career. In addition, if you aren't passionate about something, over time you'll begin to hate what you do. Sure, it may pay good, and sure, you might be good at it, but if you hate what you do every day, what good is the job? Second is proficiency. What are you good at? As my wife kept telling me, I was good at all things computers. I was also passionate about it. But both of these are not always the case. Many people are good at things that they hate doing. When you're good at something, people always come to you, and if you hate doing it, you'll be like, ah, not again. There's an auto mechanic in my area that's really good at what he does, but he complains nonstop. Every time you go in there, it's just negativity and dread. But on the other hand, if you're passionate about something, but not at all good at it, you won't succeed either. And then finally, and it's all going to come together here, there's profitability. Is the career a profitable career? If you have that passion for collecting baseball cards, and you're proficient, and you know all the ins and outs of all the years and brands, but you can't make money doing it, then it's not a good pursuit. And this is actually called a hobby. So if you have a passion, say, serving people and helping people get well, and you're proficient at it, say you went to nursing school and you passed with flying colors, then you need to check if it's profitable. And nursing pays good because they're always in demand. Check, all three are there. But if any one of these three things are lacking, then probably it isn't a wise and good calling that fits you long-term. Sure, you may work jobs here and there over the years and that's fine. Passion can come later over the importance of a paycheck. And let me be clear, being a hard worker, a person who is productive and honest and all that goes a long way. Many of us work jobs we hate for a while to pay the bills. That's a good thing. Passion is an end goal and can come later. But you eventually want to reach this intersection where you have passion for what you do, you're good at what you do, and it's a profitable industry. It's in demand. If you have the passion for something and you're good at it, but it's not a profitable career or sector to get into, you'll be poor. If you have the passion for something and it pays good, but you suck at it, you'll be fired and poor. And if you're good at something and it pays- If you raise well, but you hate what you do every single day of your life, then you'll just be a miserable person. So where are you at today? Think about these three things. First, what are you good at? Ask people. Often it's glaringly obvious to everyone but you. So ask people and then put a list together of some things that you're good at. Second, what do you love doing? What excites you when you get to work on it? What topics excite you? Maybe it's something that you haven't done in a long time, but always have had in the back of your mind. Again, make a list of a few of these things. Finally, take these two lists and cross off the things that aren't profitable. For me, I loved computers. I was good at computers. And actually, this goes way back to high school and it took me forever to realize it. And then finally, the role of software developer is a profitable career. It pays good. So here I am in my vocational calling. Can this change? Sure. I mean, here I am talking to you on YouTube. In fact, given the leverage that the World Wide Web gives you in 2024 and beyond, there are boundless opportunities out there. Crazy, I actually had a comment recently taking offense to me saying that there are endless opportunities. People like this, they're going nowhere. And they want to see everyone else fail as well. Such is the nature of negative people. And this sort of diagram can help you in many walks of life. Let me give you two examples. First, think about college degrees. Let's say you love theater. You're good at it. And you go to college for it to then get out with a ton of debt and no market for that sort of thing. That's just a hobby. Or take graphic design or fashion design, art, photography, tourism degrees. You may love these hobbies and interests and are wise and knowledgeable about them, but there's no market. So just following this chart can save you tons of money and college debt alone. And here's a second example. This diagram actually can be altered to help you figure out many other things in life. I saw this one just the other day, same kind of chart, on how to determine what video to create. So you have what you want to create, what your viewers want, and then what others are creating. Find that middle ground there and create those videos. But back to this original diagram. Where are you at? in this chart have you found the calling that covers all three of these areas yet if so full steam ahead if not let me know down in the comments what's stopping you i always love reading them if you found this video helpful give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel consider doing so and i'll see you in the next video

## Transcription

What's your story? I lived with my parents working as a waiter part-time to make I think $10 per hour. I was telling people I'm gonna make it. I'm the next Mark Zuckerberg and I'm gonna have a billion dollar startup idea and I'm gonna focus on it. This is Mark, a guy who tried everything to become an entrepreneur but nothing was working. I didn't have any salary, I didn't have any savings. I was like broke like crazy. Like we were living in like, I don't know, like 12 square meters. They were cockroaches. - Then after years of failure, he finally built a business that worked. - At some point life become like very beautiful. Like I finally, I made it. I had my apps. I make enough money to sustain my life and COVID hit. Everything that I built for the last two years just suddenly disappeared, wipe out. I've been in the journey for like almost five years already. I failed 30 startups. - And I didn't build anything, I didn't save any money, I didn't create anything that would last. And then one morning, I started to cry for no reason. - In his darkest moments, Marc does something he never thought he would have to do. - It made me question why I was an entrepreneur, why am I doing all that if I can just get a sense of worthiness having a job? - But with everything on the line, Marc discovers something that would change his life. - I felt bad and I decide I got to change everything. I'm gonna be an entrepreneur again, but these times I'll do things differently. This is the story of how Marc Lou went from working as a waiter for $10 an hour to making 1.5 million dollars a year as a solopreneur. Welcome to Starter Story. I was born in a family of engineers. None of my friends or family members are entrepreneurs And I grew up like 25 years in this ecosystem where the only thing that matters is like you have to have good school grades, you have to go university. And I think that created a frustration inside of me because I didn't, for some reason, I didn't care about school. So I was a bad kid, I had bad grades, I didn't feel like I was belonging to where I was. People wanted to do stuff and I wanted to be the opposite. University was the same so they were partying but also studying and I didn't know what I was, why I was learning what I was learning. After four years of partying and barely attending lectures, Marc graduated and had to make a big decision. When my friends and I graduated from uni, they all got a job pretty easily in Paris as software engineers. And I think around the time I might have seen the movie The Social Network with Mark Zuckerberg. And for some weird connection in my brain, I was like, this is me. I'm the next Mark Zuckerberg and I'm going to have a billion dollar startup idea and I'm going to focus on it. And the idea was to create a Tinder for sports lover. There was no Business plan in mind, there was not even an idea of how to monetize that thing. I was just, "I have to build that thing." Marc has a brilliant idea that he believes will be the next billion-dollar unicorn. So, he takes the road less traveled. As I chose a different path, I lived with my parents working as a waiter part time like at night basically to make I think $10 per hour. I was so arrogant that I spent a year working on this app. I was telling people, "I'm gonna make it." I built this identity for one year of this guy who is going to build the next brilliant idea. And you cannot even know what I'm working on because it's a brilliant idea, right? And I realized after 365 days that this app would never exist because I didn't have the capacity to build it and that he would never make money. Everything crumbled. Like all my one-year arrogant belief fell apart. And that's the moment where I stopped working on my app. Like I threw away all the code in 24 hours, quit my girlfriend because I was a terrible boyfriend and moved to South Korea, to the other side of the planet. Mark experiences his first failure, but he's still committed to becoming an entrepreneur. He wants to prove to everyone that he can do this a different way. A friend of mine gave me a call, he was in South Korea, and he said he could raise some money from VC to build an AI startup back in 2017, which was pretty cool. We were both engineers, none of us was good at marketing, none of us was good at product and business. And so we ended up having this brilliant idea again: it's going to work out if we build the product. We built the product, it took six months to make an app, but we didn't get any customers. So in the end nothing happens. After spending a year building another product that got zero customers, - Marc realized that maybe this whole venture capital thing wasn't for him. But, this gives him an idea. After the AI startups, I didn't have any salary, I didn't have any savings, I was broke like crazy. I was living with my girlfriend as well. We were living in 12 square meters. There were cockroaches in the bathroom and stuff. The frustration of doing stuff for two years that led to nothing, it made me desire, the craving for tiny projects that have quick, instant results. I saw this ad on Facebook where you have those two people holding hands together inside of one meeting with thousands of likes. I knew that if it works for them then it would work for me too. I ended up going in the street selling those gloves because I was terrible at Facebook ads so I couldn't sell any online. Even though we made zero with the gloves, we probably like sold 30 gloves, I still want to chase that thing, show a different path, show a different way and show that you can also make it with a different strategy. With three failed businesses and countless lessons learned, Mark realizes he needs to do something different. He doesn't want to be a starving artist sharing his flat with cockroaches and spending all his time working on projects that never make money. With this in mind, he starts looking for his next idea. I had this learning from those previous startups to start first with the problems and I was like what is a universal problem that everybody has that I can solve. Every business wants more customers, right? So maybe I can help any business get more customers. And the idea was to create a little tool for escape room businesses to help them get more customers. But I met a guy who is 100% marketer, his job is marketing and he's like, "Why don't you just try to sell it before you make it?" I listened to him, I did exactly what he told me, I sent some cold emails and I'm supposed to have the call with this business in Australia. It's the first time I do a call with a lead I'm thinking like an engineer and I feel like I'm scamming her just talking to her. But she's so friendly, she's like "Yeah, so what is your idea?" And in the end of the call after 42 minutes, she's like "Alright yeah send me the invoice, I'll pay." I'm sweating like my armpits are sweating so much and I make her confirm. I was like "Are you sure?" And then she said "Yes!" After a couple years and several failed ideas, Mark's efforts finally paid off. He made his first dollar. He didn't need a fancy website or a perfect product. All he needed was a solid idea and someone who is willing to pay for it. If you're someone like Mark looking for their first idea, trying to make your first dollar online, then I have something special for you. This is a free breakdown of 50+ solo developer ideas to help you get started. It includes a bunch of stuff: business models, revenue, strategies, and a bunch of other stuff you'd want to know. And it's for everyone. No coders, developers, indie hackers. Just click the first link in the description and we'll send it over to you for free. Mark's efforts finally paid off. He's made his first dollar online but most importantly, he now knows firsthand that entrepreneurship works. But when everything was at its best, something very unexpected happened. So this VirallyBot project quickly made some enough money to sustain my life. like $1,000 per month. We moved to Bali and my days would be exactly the same. I would send some emails in the morning, try to get someone on the phone call exactly like I did for the first dollar on the internet. And the revenue grew to at the top, it went until $4,000 in monthly recurring revenue. At some point life become very beautiful. Like finally I made it. I have my apps, I work on my own project. I don't have any meetings. I have customers. I make enough money to sustain my life. I live in Bali, I learned how to surf. It's just so nice. The revenue is going up And then I was working with physical businesses and COVID hit. Everything closed down, revenue went from $4000 a month to zero in like 24 hours. Everything that I built for the last two years just suddenly disappeared, wiped out. After COVID brings Marc's business to zero, he decides to take a break. He keeps on surfing and living life. Then when the lockdown eased, something insane happened. My girlfriend and I decided to get married so we flew back to France And we had a beautiful wedding. After a couple weeks, they started to lock down everything again. We were supposed to come back to Bali but we couldn't. So I'm 28 years old and I'm a married man - And I don't make any revenue. Most of the businesses I've tried failed, and I think in this moment, I feel not so good. Like, I don't know why I'm doing all that anymore. I feel like I've never achieved anything really. And I'm back at 28 years old in the house where I left to try to show there was another way showing that I failed basically. And then one morning, I have no clue what is happening. I start to cry for no reason. Like, I usually control my emotions. I start to cry but I have no idea what's going on. And I look at my wall and I start to punch my wall four times, like without even thinking. My wall is pretty thin so it goes through the wall and I'm shouting and I'm like... I don't know, like so much anger that just comes out. It's like I've never felt this bad before. I don't really know what depression is but this lack of control that I had on me and these emotions bursting out without me controlling anything... maybe. After five years of failure with no income or savings, 28 year old freshly married Mark decides to do something that he never thought he would have to do. He applies for a few software engineering jobs. Luckily, because of his experience, he quickly lands one of the positions. And the job is like, we're offering you $9,000 a month. I look at that and was like, I'm be I've been making $1,000 a month for five years. And now you're offering me 9000 US dollars per month. I was like, what the fuck is going on? So I jumped straight into the job. And when you - Have a job, your boss is telling you today, I want you to do that. So at the end of the day, once you've done that, you've created the value for the person and it makes you feel like you're worthy. I didn't get any of this in the past so it really feels like I was useful to someone. - Making more money than he ever had all while feeling useful to society, Mark starts to question if he was ever meant to become an entrepreneur. And maybe for him having a regular job "is enough to live a fulfilling life." - Those years of entrepreneurship, you aim to create something people want. And when nothing is actually working, you're basically creating void and nobody cares about what you do, nobody needs anything that you're doing so it feels like you are just useless. It made me question why I was an entrepreneur, why am I doing all that if I can just get a sense of worthiness having a job? I started to have time for me on weekends because I didn't allow myself to take time off in the past. It made me prioritize other parts of my life that I haven't touched previously from sleep to reading books to working out and the overall happiness everything like the burst i had previously everything started to fade away and i started to feel much better six months after getting the job a lockdown started to disappear and my wife and i decided to go back to buddy i started to feel this little desire of freedom that i didn't crave previously because i had 100 freedom but zero percent worthiness but now the fact that i had to show up from monday to friday within two months i was already thinking like "Sometimes I don't want to do this meeting. "I don't want to go there, I don't want to do that." And I was seeing some tweets from other software engineers who either got fired, who pursued their passion, whatever, and I see that there are some guys who have a totally different approach to entrepreneurship. They don't raise money, they don't work with the team, they do whatever they want, they build tiny projects, they make it fast. Maybe I want that. - A little seed is planted in Marc's mind yet again that maybe he can actually do this, but he remembers all of the failures he's gone through. Plus, he's got a great job and he's not ready to quit right away. Then one day he receives a phone call that would change his life. Around this time in Bali, like couple months after we're here, I just received a call they're like "hey it was nice working with you bye" And so when I got fired it was totally fine because I was already thinking of going back to the entrepreneurship world to get that sense for freedom fulfilled again. - The moment I get fired, I build my new identity. I'm gonna be an entrepreneur again, but these times I'll do things differently. I will never spend a month on a product. I will never raise money, I'll never have employees. I'll never do all the things that frustrated me in the past. I started to realize that each failure is not a failure if you don't give up. Each failure is a learning or a frustration for a future success. And unless I quit in the middle, all those failures will bring the success later. It's just making a matter of making small bets. Small bet here, small bet there. and maybe something will work out. I also decided to, at the same time I build stuff, I'm going to try to share this publicly so that people can see it so that if my app goes wrong, if nothing happens, then in the worst case, maybe I'll have created a little following that's for the next project that I can use to get some eyeballs and not starting again from zero. With a reignited passion and a new approach to entrepreneurship, Marc starts to ship. The first app I built is called Mood2Movie. It's basically an app that matches your mood and recommend you movies based on how you feel. And then Habits Garden, it's like a little habit tracker. I got around 10,000 users, which I was super proud of because it's like also like it's helping people to get better in life. I was so happy. I worked on a tool that ranks productivity tips. I built a landing page generator. So you input some text and it's gonna create an entire website for you with text images and buttons. I created a link in bio tool for entrepreneurs where you can Show your entrepreneur resume. Mark launched six projects in seven months, but he was still facing a big problem: income. He was only making $1,000 a month and he needed to figure out how to crack the code to make more money. I started to make painkiller apps where it's actually solving problems like I try to focus on that and also try to focus on apps that are not free that like users at some point have a paywall. The fact that I was shipping painkillers means something People know their struggle, they know their pain. So I come up with a solution. So it's much easier to sell than a vitamin where like the habit tracker for instance where it's fun but you don't necessarily need it. And try to get a new approach of like launching viral. I would focus on the launch part, try to get as many ice balls as i can and I started to make those skits where I would go on a podcast with Jorogun or I would be in a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio and this did really well. Like people felt that I was having fun and that's where my revenue went from around $1,000 per month to I think it was around $4,000. In 2023, mid-2023, I had built somewhere around 10 to 15 products. And I realized I was doing the same thing over. Set up a landing page, deploy it, add a button for people to pay, send them an email, create an account. I was like, what if I just create a little code base that I can reuse for every new project that I create? So whenever I have a new idea, I can make it faster. I can ship it faster. I did that. I built it, I think, in less than a week. And I was like, this is super cool. Why not just putting a price tag on it and offering it to other developers if they want to use it. But I removed expectations from anything that would launch. I told my wife, "Hey, maybe we'll make 100 bucks. That would be nice." I shipped the product, went skating and I came back home, opened my dashboard, my strap dashboard after two hours of skate. I was like, "I made 500 bucks," which is what I would make in a week on entrepreneurship before, in two hours. I was like, "Something's going wrong." I really couldn't believe it. And then the next day, I had made somewhere like around 3 to 4 thousand US dollars. And I was like, what the fuck is going on? Like I would make my best monthly salary in one day. Just insane. I think the first month I made around 40 thousand US dollars. The second month, November for the Black Friday, that day I made seven, I think 8 thousand US dollars. I was very surprised. It was steady around like 50 thousand dollars a month except in November where there was like a burst at 65. And I realized one thing is product market fit, when it hits, it's there. You can feel it. I would receive messages from people that said like, "Hey, I cannot pay using your credit cards. Do you accept crypto?" You would have people ask me to give me money. It was the first time ever. Usually I'm trying to convince people to give me money for my product. I felt so happy. I couldn't sleep at night. I was awake looking at emails, looking at the Stripe dashboard going up. I don't know, it's a pure bliss feeling. It's just insane. And receiving those messages from people who's like, Thank you, you changed my life. For me it was like... I don't know if I can ever be happier than that. So the launch gave it an initial boost. I also did lots of free tools marketing. So I would build these logo generators and then on the right side you would have a banner that says: "Are you building a startup? Ship it fast with ShipFast." And there's obviously the YouTube episode that came a little bit later. It added lots of revenue to The product she passed, so it went from like $50,000 a month to somewhere around $85,000 on the first month. Then $135,000 in the second month, $135,000 in the third months. And now it's slowing down a little bit to somewhere like around $80,000 a month. Okay, so I do believe there are multiple people living up there and there is one that's very strong and that always thinking. He's telling you stuff, he's overthinking, he's blocking you from making the first step. He's gonna find a good excuse for this idea to not work. It's gonna tell you that the idea you're working on is not perfect enough to be launched. So my advice would be to, it's cliche but it's: start anything, start. Make the smallest version of your app as fast as you can. And the second part, learn where you're comfortable sharing your ideas. If it's text go on Twitter, if you're comfortable with videos go on TikTok, if you're comfortable with images and you know how to tell beautiful stories with one image go on Instagram. And learn how to blend those two things together and see how Things react. I failed 30 startups around that, but if you don't quit then at some point you'll win. It's just a matter of not quitting before you win. Start now and ship fast. That's Mark's formula for being a successful online entrepreneur. But here's the problem: when you're starting out and when you have an idea for something, you don't really know a whole lot about what to do. You don't know necessarily if the idea is good, you don't know how to validate it, and you don't know how to monetize it. Well, the best way to learn is to talk to people or study people who are a few steps ahead of you. That's what Starter Story is for.
